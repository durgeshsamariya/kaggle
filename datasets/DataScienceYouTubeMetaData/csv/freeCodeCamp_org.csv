Now with the coronavirus pandemic, we need social interaction more than ever. Our community has been hard at work on a number of major improvements to the freeCodeCamp curriculum. We've been publishing a ton of free courses on YouTube. And we have other new tools we're excited to demo, too. Here's what we'll cover during this one-hour stream. * The 4 new Python-focused certifications * In late 2019, we started work on 4 new Python certifications. These are all part of freeCodeCamp's core curriculum, and will immediately follow our existing 6 web development certifications (which will initially remain unchanged). Beau will demo these new certifications and explain how we're rolling them out. We will also give a big update on how we're rolling out Version 7.0 of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. As I said in December, we are moving to 100% project-oriented learning. These new practice projects will be 100% optional, and none of this will affect people who are already going through freeCodeCamp's curriculum and earning certifications. We are excited to demo these new certifications, which we'll open to beta testers in May. * Big improvements to the YouTube channel * As you may have heard, the freeCodeCamp community's YouTube channel is growing. I'll talk about our commitment to keeping the channel ad-free. I'll also show how we're focusing on YouTube membership as a way to sustain our nonprofit. And some new freeCodeCamp swag you can buy to support the community: shirts, caps, even mugs. And good news: we're going to be live-streaming a lot more. * Demoing the new Contributor Site * We have a new area of freeCodeCamp dedicated to helping contributors get started with code contributions, adding subtitles to videos, answering questions from the community, and more. Mrugesh will demo the site and a lot of its key functionality. Mrugesh will also talk about some of the exciting things he's doing to keep freeCodeCamp running fast under the growing server death-hug of people around the world learning to code. We are moving the freeCodeCamp Guide over to our publication Abbey will talk about the process of transitioning all of the articles from the freeCodeCamp Guide over to our publication. This means all of our guide articles will have better accessibility, with large text and a clean single-column layout. We will also have JSON Schema, AMP versions of articles, and a lot of other features to make it fast and accessible. Abbey will also give us an update on the state of freeCodeCamp's publication – which is now getting more readership than many major newspapers. Finally, she'll demo our navigation search bar tool, which now averages nearly 1 million searches per week. * Updates on the community forum and chat rooms * I will talk about freeCodeCamp's online community – spread across our forum, chat rooms, the r/freeCodeCamp subreddit and the freeCodeCamp Earth Facebook group. These online communities have become increasingly important in an age of national lockdowns and social distancing measures. Nothing beats hanging out with other developers in person. But since this isn't possible currently, we are making sure everyone has access to the next-best thing – online developer communities. * Then we will answer any questions you all may have. * Here's the full agenda: 10.00 Quincy talks about YouTube: merchandise, YouTube membership, superchat, and more frequent streams 10.05 Quincy talks about growth of community: the forum, chat rooms, subreddit, and more 10.10 Mrugesh demos the Contributor site 10.15 Mrugesh talks about efforts to improve performance at scale 10.20 Abbey talks about the Guide-to-News transition 10.25 Abbey shares a few big recent articles, and talks about our editorial philosophy 10.30 Beau demos the new Python curriculum and talks about the instructional design work we're doing 10.45 Questions & Answers 11.00 Guest Coding Session with Florin Pop - Florin Pop - YouTube Channel: https://youtube.com/florinpop Twitter: https://twitter.com/florinpop1705 Website: https://florin-pop.com Stay safe, everyone.

In this tutorial you will go from having zero knowledge to writing an artificial intelligence that can compose Shakespearean prose. No prior experience with deep learning is required, though it is always helpful to have more background information. We’ll use a combination of embedding layers, recurrent neural networks, and fully connected layers to perform the classification. ⭐️Course Contents ⭐️ ⌨️ (01:16) Getting Started with Word Embeddings ⌨️ (33:25) How to Perform Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews ⌨️ (59:32) Let’s Write An AI That Writes Shakespeare ⭐️Course Description ⭐️ The basic idea behind natural language processing is that we start out with words, i.e. strings of characters, that are almost impossible for the computer to meaningfully parse. We can transform these strings into a vector in a higher dimensional space. Different words will be represented as vectors of different lengths and directions in this space, and this allows us to find relationships between words by finding the component of one vector along another. Don’t worry, the TensorFlow library handles all of this, we just have to have some basic idea of how it works. Since this is a type of supervised learning, we also have labels for our text. This allows the AI to compare the relationships between words to the training labels, and learn which sequences of words represent good and bad movie reviews. This would also work for finding toxic comments, fake product reviews… just about anything for which we need a multiclass classification of text – provided we have enough training data and labels. The last step in complexity is to change the final layer that handles the classification. This allows us to actually output text that the AI thinks is meaningful. What’s really special about this is that the neural network starts out not even knowing that letters are a thing, or that we use spaces and punctuation, to producing something that approximates human level writing. ⭐️Code ⭐️ 🔗Word Embeddings: https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/text/word_embeddings.ipynb 🔗Text Classification: https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/text/text_classification_rnn.ipynb 🔗Text Generation: https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/text/text_generation.ipynb ⭐️Resources ⭐️ As stated in the videos, these are from the official TensorFlow tutorials.

In this full tutorial course, you will get a solid foundation in reinforcement learning core topics. The course covers Q learning, SARSA, double Q learning, deep Q learning, and policy gradient methods. These algorithms are employed in a number of environments from the open AI gym, including space invaders, breakout, and others. The deep learning portion uses Tensorflow and PyTorch. The course begins with more modern algorithms, such as deep q learning and policy gradient methods, and demonstrates the power of reinforcement learning. Then the course teaches some of the fundamental concepts that power all reinforcement learning algorithms. These are illustrated by coding up some algorithms that predate deep learning, but are still foundational to the cutting edge.

Code: https://github.com/eXtremeXR/Async-Await First, we're going to go through brief history of asynchronous programming in JavaScript and see how it transitioned from callbacks to promises to generators and to finally Async/Await. Then we're going to focus purely on Async/Await and we'll go through a bunch of examples. We'll start off by learning how we can do sequential flow using Async/Await and we'll also see how we need to be careful about error handling. Next, we'll move onto parallel execution. We'll see how we can use Promise.all() function to be able to execute multiple promises in parallel. Again, we'll see why we need to be careful about our error handling. Last but not least, we'll take a look at how we can do iterations with Async/Await. We'll start off with for loop, then move onto forEach, for of loop is going to be next and finally we'll wrap that section with while loop. At the end, we'll do a quick recap of the things we just went through. ⭐️Contents ⭐️ ⌨️ 0:00 - Introduction ⌨️ 1:28 - Callbacks Example ⌨️ 6:44 - Promises Example ⌨️ 9:40 - Async/Await Example ⌨️ 13:18 - Coding Examples Begin ⌨️ 14:09 - Sequential Example (Naive) ⌨️ 19:27 - Sequential Example (Issue) ⌨️ 21:18 - Sequential Example (Solution) ⌨️ 23:48 - Parallel Example (Naive) ⌨️ 27:21 - Parallel Example (Issue) ⌨️ 28:58 - Parallel Example (Solution) ⌨️ 31:55 - For Loop Example ⌨️ 36:49 - ForEach Example ⌨️ 40:06 - For-Of Example ⌨️ 42:06 - While Loop Example ⌨️ 44:03 - Recap Tutorial from CodeWorkr.

Without servers, we'd have no way to share our creations with the world. Yet, in a bit of a paradox, servers are less essential to our work than they've ever been. We can now do things on the front-end that used to require a back end. When we do need a back end, our front-end skills can be put to work, giving us some surprisingly powerful new abilities. Join Chris on a whirlwind tour of the tools, tech, and code that puts more power than ever into our front-end hands. Talk by Chris Coyier. Recorded at JAMstack Conf 2018 in San Francisco.

Its evolved from a simple two week hack into a vibrant ecosystem that is continuously evolving to the modern web. Join Matt as he walks the timeline of JavaScripts evolution from where it began into what it has become today. If you are new to web development or just getting back into development or coming to web development from a different part of the stack this is for you. Matt will showcase several demo apps that highlight the differences in how web apps used to be built with ES5 and highlight the tools that have changed how they are built for the modern web and ES6. Finally he will show how that same app can be built with Angular, one of the many modern frameworks that helps engineers build responsive and performant web applications.

Building a web Application Programming Interface (API) traditionally involves a significant amount of work: defining routes, writing functions to fetch and shape data, ensuring a consistent interface, documenting the API, and more. GraphQL, an open source alternative framework for fetching data over HTTP, seeks to reduce much of the overhead of building more traditional web APIs. All data from a web service is provided at a single endpoint, and consumers can discover data schemas to then build and run queries to get only the data they need. The result is faster and more efficient development experience in many aspects of building and consuming the data layer. Talk by Daniel Lemay at the PDX Node meetup at OSCON 2018.

We will play with resources, behavior, relations, parameters, headers, collections, versioning, errors, security, throttling, cache, HATEOAS, management performance, health and business.

However, when compared to effects available in graphics editors such as Photoshop and the likes, CSS is still behind, by far. But SVG, on the other hand, is not that far behind. SVG comes with a set of filter primitives that enable you to recreate Photoshop-grade effects in the browser, using a few lines of code. While the syntax and attributes of these filters may seem intimidating and not very friendly at first, once you get a grasp of how they work, you’ll have a very powerful tool in your arsenal, that allows you to push the boundaries of what is possible on the Web. In this talk, Sara is going to give you a crash course on SVG filters — why they are awesome, how they work, and examples of powerful effects you can create with them, in an friendly, easy-to-follow approach. Brace yourself, and get ready to set your imagination free and expand your creativity for what’s possible on the Web today. -- This talk was given at the beyond tellerrand 2018 conference by Sara Soueidan.

After a few years working as a Front-end dev, I looked at a list of ""JS interview"" questions and realized that I couldn't answer many of them (at least not well).

Regardless of how you feel about getting asked random questions meant to trick you up in an interview (you should be appalled), my talk will cover some basic JS subtleties, and hopefully fill in some knowledge gaps w/r/t: - Hoisting and variable scope - Expressions v. statements - Undeclared v. undefined v. null - Equality comparisons - How to properly walk out if an interviewer asks you to do fizz buzz This talk was given at Nodevember 2016 by Russell Anderson.

That's all changed with the release of WebAssembly. This talk will look at what WebAssembly is, why it matters and crucially what it means for JavaScript and the future of web development. JavaScript brought interactivity to the web more than 20 years ago, and despite numerous challengers, it is still the only language supported by browser. However, as those 20 years have passed we've moved from adding a little interactivity to largely static sites, to creating complex JavaScript-heavy single page applications. Throughout this journey, the way we use JavaScript itself has also changed. Gone are the days of writing simple code snippets that are run directly in the browser. Nowadays we transpile, minify, tree-shake and more, treating the JavaScript virtual machine as a compilation target. The problem is, JavaScript isn't a very good compilation target, because it simply wasn't designed to be one. Born out of asm.js, a somewhat crazy concept dreamt up by Mozilla, WebAssembly was designed from the ground-up as an efficient compilation target for the web. It promises smaller payloads, rapid parsing and validation and consistent performance ... and it's ready to use, right now! This talk will look at what's wrong with the way we are using JavaScript today and why we need WebAssembly. It will delve into the internals, giving a quick tour of the WebAssembly instruction set, memory and security model, before moving on to the more practical aspects of using it with Rust, C++ and JavaScript. Finally we'll do some crystal-ball gazing and see what the future of this rapidly evolving technology might hold. Talk by Colin Eberhardt at the JS Monthly London Meetup. Recorded by Pusher.com.

But why? The answer is simple: Functional Scala lets you think less. It reduces the number of moving parts you need to hold in your head, lets you stay focussed and saves your mental stack from overflowing. In this talk I'll show you how to stop treating Scala as a better Java and start exploring the world of Functional Programming. I'll use code examples to demonstrate a four step path that'll let you ease yourself into the world of Functional Programming while continuing to deliver production quality code. With each step we'll learn a new technique, and understand how it leaves you with less to think about: Hopefully this talk will convince you that Functional Scala leads to code that's easier to hold in your head, and leave you excited about learning a new paradigm.

Just because failure happens doesn’t mean we can’t do our best to prevent it or—at the very least—to minimize the damage when it does. As a matter of fact, embracing failure can be one of the best things you do for your system. Failure is a vital part of evolution. By learning to love failure we learn how to take the next step forward. Ignoring or punishing failure leads to stagnation and wasted potential. This talk distills 3000 pages of failure research into 40 minutes of knowledge about the human factors of failure, how it can be recognised, and how you can work around it to create more resilient systems. By the end of this talk the audience will have an awareness of the most common psychological reasons for mistakes and failures and how to develop systems and processes to protect against them. -- Talk given by VM Vicky Brasseur at PyCon 2018.

It's a very handy tool for the working programmer, but it's often shrouded in off-putting mathematics. In this talk, I'll teach you what you need to know about Big-O, and how to use it to keep your programs running well. Big-O helps you choose the data structures and algorithms that will let your code work efficiently even on large data sets. You can understand Big-O even if you aren't a theoretical computer science math nerd. Big-O isn't as mystical as it appears. It's wrapped in mathematical trappings, but doesn't have to be more than a common-sense assessment of how your code will behave. Talk given by Ned Batchelder at PyCon 2018.

Some traits come more easily to mind than others when it comes to identifying a great developer. In this talk we will take a slightly different approach to evaluating software development best practices, and identify one underrated skill common to great software developers: empathy. I hope to demonstrate that cognitive and emotional empathy skills are critical to good software development. We will explore ways to cultivate this trait in order to become better developers, both for our own sakes and for the sake of the teams in which we work. Talk given at PyCon 2018 by Esther Nam.

Are you interested in seeing how Kubernetes stands up to the record-breaking viewership and a login rate that is beyond belief on Game of Thrones Season 7 premiere? Come and see things we have done for the Game of Thrones preparation. We will talk about how we provision Kubernetes clusters on AWS, and how we monitor them and microservices that are running on the clusters. In this talk, we will also go over how HBO Go went from deploying and running microservices on virtual machines in AWS EC2 to running the very same services inside the Kubernetes clusters. We were able to dramatically increase the productivity of our engineering teams and efficiency of resource utilization in the process. It wasn’t always a smooth ride and it wasn’t a one shot deal. Instead, it was a long and at times challenging journey starting from operating a reliable, production-ready Kubernetes cluster in AWS, advancing to gradually deploying select services into Kubernetes clusters, load testing them, and running them in parallel to our current EC2 installations, and finally going live. Come and learn some helpful tips and mistakes we made along the way, which could help your organization embrace the Kubernetes world.

By now, a lot of developers are aware of their practical uses, such as small and accessible icons, or illustrations. In this session, though, Sarah will go beyond typical use cases. She’ll cover a few practical things like styling SVG icons like typography, and then dive into the creative wilds of this graphic format built with math. She’ll make it respond to physics, make it bounce and snap, stack it like legos for responsive, and make it interactive with front-end frameworks like Vue.js and React. In this session Sarah will push the boundaries of what’s possible while also thinking about cross-browser stability, and you’ll come out of it with a whole new world of tools in your front-end developer toolbox. Sarah Drasner is an award-winning speaker, consultant, and staff writer at CSS-Tricks. She is also the co-founder of Web Animation Workshops, with Val Head and the author of SVG Animations from O’Reilly. Sarah is formerly Manager of UX Design & Engineering at Trulia (Zillow).

This equates to 7.2 million businesses. - If each of these businesses paid $3,000 for a website then that would be a total market of $21,600,000 (7.2m * $3,000). How you can stand out from other freelancers. - It’s important to recognize that most developers don’t do a good job of connecting with potential customers. - There are a plenty of web developers in the US. Despite this, 7.2 million small businesses don’t have a website. - The fact that there is a high number of developers and a high number of businesses still in need of service indicates a “disconnect” between the development community and the small business community. - The best way to bridge the “disconnect” is to identify and solve the problems of small businesses. - Developers must talk to small businesses about their problems and how software will solve those problems. - Many developers make the mistake of talking about software and code and not about problem solving. - Taking a “problem solver” approach will help bridge the disconnect between developers and small businesses. How to sell your services. - The initial meeting/phone call is your opportunity to connect with the customer. - Use your initial meeting with a potential customer to identify the customer’s needs and problems. - Identifying the potential customer’s problems requires in-depth questions and follow up. - Close the sale by explaining how software will solve the problems you have identified. - Give specifics as to functions the software will perform and how those functions will solve the problems you have identified. This is more effective than the approach of many other developers - Your written proposal must be specific as to the services you are providing. This avoids disputes. Where to sell your services - Networking events can help generate business. - DO NOT go to networking events which are mostly made up of developers. It’s better if you’re the only developer in the room. - BNI (https://www.bni.com/) is a good place to network with small business owners. - Third party services can help you find customers - Thumbtack.com and Fiverr.com are good places to find customers. - Third party services/platforms often include fees for listing your services and you will often perform work for reduced rates. - Your own website can bring in business. - This doesn’t require the time of networking and alleviates the problems of third-party services/platforms - Google Adwords is a way to promote your website. Adwords, however can be expensive.

I have learn React on my own and recruiters do not seem to appreciate it. Further, at this stage at the big companies, I reach 1-2 rounds behind the final round and then they say they found a more experienced person for the role. Recently I got a rejection from the [COMPANY X] and [COMPANY Y . These both required 5-6 years of industry experience. My application took me to the initial rounds and they seemed interested in gauging my potential - only to find I was not as good as somebody they were looking for. Next week I am appearing for a full stack role at [COMPANY Z] but it is clearly out of my league - they are seeking at least 6 years experience in JavaScript. I am pursuing it for interview experience + what if it works out somehow? I do not know many people who can refer me. How do I get my first React job [without any industry experience]?

Discrete Mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with discrete or finite sets of elements rather than continuous or infinite sets of elements. Imagine trying to run a program that requires an infinite number of executions to complete a task. It's obvious to say, that the program would run forever and the task would never be completed because there is an infinite number of executions. In order to avoid this problem, we approximate the continuous sets with discrete sets. Now you may be thinking, I never use math that involves infinite sets, but I promise that you do. The simplest example is with a circle. A circle by definition is an infinite number of points equally distant from a fixed point. The problem with this is that if we try to write a program that prints out all of these points, it will run forever because there is an infinite number of points and therefore an infinite number of executions. So, this is physically impossible, that's why if we zoom in here, you can see that when you come down here, there is all these points, but in reality we should have even more points between these points. And if we zoom in on those, we should have more points between those points, and we can never complete the task. Now we've all seen circles on computers, how is this possible, because we just established that it's impossible. The answer is, is that there is approximations. For example, consider regular polygons. Regular Polygons, like a triangle, or a square, or a pentagon. They don't really look like circles. However, if you keep increasing the number of vertices. Eventually you will get hexagons, octagons, decagons, hexadecagons, icosagons. You can see that these regular polygons, the more and more you increase the number of vertices, which the vertices are equally distant from a fixed point, they will eventually approximate a circle, and eventually they will be indistinguishable to the naked eye and will look identical to a circle.

And in this video I will be giving you three tips on how to learn Discrete Mathematics. The first tip is to stay calm. People often hear the word Mathematics and panic. When you panic, you stop listening. If you stop listening, you can't learn the material. If you simply stay calm, then you'll be able to learn the material better. You aren't being graded on the subject so there's no need to panic. The second is to rewind. You can rewind the videos at any time. When I learned Discrete Mathematics I didn't have this opportunity. In theory you should be able to learn the material much faster than I was ever able to. I strongly encourage rewinding the video. Finally, explain. Once you think you understand the material of the videos you can try to explain the material out loud either to yourself or to a friend. If no one is around, or you feel weird talking to yourself then you can try and explain it to a rubber ducky. There's a concept in Programming called Rubber Ducky debugging, which is where programmers go through their code, line by line, trying to identify bugs in their code by explaining it to a rubber ducky. So similarly, if you go through the material of the videos, subject by subject, you will soon be able to identify any gaps in your understanding of the material.

Today we're going to discuss how they work together to build a beautiful experience for you and everyone else that visits the internet. The web designer, what they do will impact the 'How' the UI and UX looks and feels. The web developer, what they do will impact 'What' the UX and UI will do once you start to click on buttons. An example is the login process. A designer will decide where the login process will start on the page. A developer will decide what that process will entail. Are you logging in with your email address, username or social media account? Another example is building a car. A designer will choose what color the car is. Is it red, white, or blue? Cloth or leather seats? Tinted windows? A developer will decide if it's a V6 or V8 engine. Is it a gasoline, hybrid or all electric vehicle? Together, they work to build a beautiful experience for you and everyone else that visits the internet.

Thank you for joining me on this short hike about Open Source code. I'm going to explain open source code by comparing it to its opposite, closed source code. There are a variety of models in between the two. Open source code is published, shared, public, and supported by the community. Closed source code is not published, not shared, not public, and it is not supported by a community. What makes open source code so important to us is the fact that it is supported by the community. Anything that is created with open source code is done by those who use it. An example of open source code would be Linux software. It's opposite would be Windows or Apple's OSX operating systems. Linux was created and is available for free and it is supported by the community. However, all open source code isn't free. Some are, most are. But, the major difference between open source code and all other types of code is the fact that it's, the code is available for you to use and then improve upon. An example would be a recipe. You can find recipes online. You buy the same products in stores and not have access to the recipes. One example is Coca-Cola. You get Coca-Cola in a variety of flavors. If you want a new flavor of Coca-Cola, you must wait for the organization that owns the recipe to make that new flavor. You can ask for it, but there's no guarantee you'll get it. With a recipe you can find for your own cola online, you can make changes to it. Make your own cola, your own cherry, your own vanilla, your own chocolate cola and then you can share that with the rest of the community and that will be an open source recipe, an open source product. Again, open source public, published, shared. Open source software is supported by and improved upon by the community. - We're busy people who learn to code, then practice by building projects for nonprofits.

Let's cover computer security. The first thing we're going to talk about is something called a dictionary attack which has to do with your passwords. When creating your passwords, some sites require extremely specific and complicated passwords, which is actually a bit unnecessary. The type of attacks they're trying to gaurd you from are dictionary attacks. Dictionary attacks are programmed to try every word in the dictionary, or in its own database of common words and passwords, as the password for a large mass of usernames. If your password is Kangaroo, they're probably going to break into your account. Most passwords aren't this simple, but that doesn't matter. They attack such a massive amount of accounts that they only need a few passwords that are relatively simple. When creating a password, you want to use different cases, numbers, and symbols, but one of the most effective ways to create a good password is to throw some random letters in there (ex: kangarooSyCA67). Also, stay away from sequential numbers. Phishing, another thing to watch out for, is emails or webpages that mimic other valid sites to try and trick people into entering their personal information, though the site truly isn't connected to the site it's trying to mimic. In general, two ways to safeguard from these attacks are checking the address in the browser and to open a new browser and go to the website that is claiming to contact you. Let's also discuss encryption and HTTPS. If you are at Starbucks trying to access your bank account, you have reason to be suspicious that someone could see and take your information. You will want to look for a green HTTPS instead of HTTP at the beginning of the web address. That means that the site you're sending your information to is encrypting your passwords and other information, scrambling up data according to a code that only they know. In general, whenever you're showing private or sensitive information, check for HTTPS. A few other general tips: don't share passwords between important accounts. If a site you use gets hacked into, your password may be compromised regardless of its strength. Also, don't download strange files. If you don't recognise the file type like .pdf, .txt, .jpg, be wary. Some of these files you download can be very powerful and even run your computer from the inside. Lastly, keep your software updated, particularly software that interacts with the internet. One way that information can be compromised is when 'bad guys' find holes and gaps in security of older versions of softwares. Those bugs have been patched in newer versions, so if you keep everything updated, you'll avoid lots of problems. These are all very basic things you should know about how to keep your information safe on your computer.",27,Education,PT5M6S,306,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wNuRKyMJRQk/maxresdefault.jpg,,22833,108,6,0,10

To know how the internet works, we're going to talk first about IP addresses. You may be familliar with the fact that each of your devices has its own IP address, just like a house or an apartment has its own address. The internet can't deliver data to a device unless it has an IP address. Not only does your device have one, but so does the modem, the router, and every step along the way, which we'll get to later. IP addresses are determined based on location, starting with 5 big international regions. Moving from left to right, the numbers mean something specific about your location. This number isn't specific enough that you could call 911, give them your IP address, and have them know where you live. However, it is specific enough that you could google \Where's the best ice cream near me\ and google could give you information close to your location.

The goal of a CDN is to establish higher quality network connections. CDNs accomplish this by providing effective routes between their own servers that can fast-track users to their destination, or if its faster and/or cheaper, another copy of that website destination that is being hosted on another server. This concept and type of service is not new, but is becoming more popular as the internet grows. Websites contract and pay a CDN service, who in turn pays an internet provider to use their servers for their data. An example of CDNs are Google's Hosted Libraries. -- https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#jquery Google hosts these libraries so that your users can load them into your own site much more quickly than if you host them yourself. There's a chance the user's browser is even storing a cached version from visiting a previous page, making the process even quicker. If you aren't familliar with the term 'cache', don't worry, we'll cover that in future videos. As a user, you probably use CDNs all the time without realizing it. As a developer, you may want to use CDNs like google libraries to help your page load more quickly. As a company, a CDN would be useful if you want your product or site to reach users more efficiently in the larger scheme of their network and the internet as a whole.",27,Education,PT2M14S,134,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hBxs3wEZyAs/maxresdefault.jpg,1,16931,130,2,0,5

The DOM is the browser's internal, progrematic representation of a webpage. Languages like javascript allow you to modify the DOM, and thus the website without editing the HTML of the page. Technically, the DOM is an API (application programming interface). There are many types of APIs, but this particular API interacts with XML and HTML documents. It's in charge of how those documents are accessed and manipulated. Really, you can do a lot with the dom, and if you're already scripting in JS and jQuery, you're already doing it. You can insert new things, elements, or alter style or content for elements that already exist. This can be done with pure javascript, like: document.getElementById(id) element.getElementsByTagName(name) document.createElement(name) You can also use libraries like jQuery to simplify, standardize and automate manipulating the DOM, like: $('#box2').append(""This will be added to box2!"")",27,Education,PT2M50S,170,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/80Mr2Z6Qikc/maxresdefault.jpg,1,57020,637,30,0,38

Time complexity is classified by the nature of the function T(n). O represents the function, and (n) represents the number of elements to be acted on. Worst-case time complexity, the longest it could possibly take with any valid input, is the most common way to express time complexity. When you discuss Big-O notation, that is generally referring to the worst case scenario. For example, if we have to search two lists for common entries, we will calculate as if both entries would be at the very end of each list, just to be safe that we don't underestimate how long it could take. O(1) - determining if a number is odd or even. O(1) is a static amount of time, the same no matter how much information is there or how many users there are. O(log N) - finding a word in the dictionary (using binary search). Binary search is an example of a type of ""divide and conquor"" algorithm. O(N) - reading a book O(N log N) - sorting a deck of playing cards (using merge sort) O(N^2) - checking if you have everything on your shopping list in your cart O(infinity) - tossing a coin until it lands on heads As a rule of thumb, anything with N^2 or any other exponent is NOT a good algorithm for a site with multiple users. If your algorithm slows down exponentially with the input, you're going to want to look for a more efficient way to solve that problem. Whenever you’re coding loops within loops, you want to be especially mindful of time complexity. http://bigocheatsheet.com/ Big O Cheat Sheet is the place to look once you can classify your algorithm, like as a ""merge-sort"" or a ""quick-sort"". https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI Princeton Coursera course is NOT for the faint of heart.

Ever asked yourself why? If you've ever seen a webpage that loads the text first, then after a bit loads the formatting and style, you've seen a page that didn't have the links to style and script in the correct places. This all has to do with how the browser decides it's loaded enough information to display. There's an event called 'DOMContentLoaded', and once that event happens, whatever is loaded will be displayed. The DOM will tell the browser it's ready once the HTML is loaded, and sometimes the CSS and JS hasn't caught up. However, if you place the CSS in the header and the JS in the footer, you can ensure that all content will be loaded before the DOM triggers the 'DOMContentLoaded' event, the event that shows the user your content. This is a simple explaination, as most of these videos are.

This is useful in streamlining software so it works as fast as possible. When you're writing code, you should be aware of how long it's going to take to execute. Nobody wants to create a product that users find frustrating due to slow use. Time complexity is talked about in relation to an algorithm, a collection of one or more functions. Big O Notation specifically helps you identify when an algorithm wouldn't 'scale' well, or work well with varying amounts of users, information, or other inputs. This does NOT correspond with Moore's law - no matter how big and fast your computer is, if the algorithm is exponentially inefficient, it's realistically unusable. Additionally, questions about Big O Notation and time complexity can be used as interview questions. Your employers will want to know that the code you write will not take too long to load on the page for the users, and knowledge of Big O Notation shows that you're cognizant of that while writing your code. The take-away from this video is that Big O Notation helps you identify where there could be problems (sometimes BIG problems) in speed and memory when your site or app grows.",27,Education,PT2M36S,156,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KSNx22U4uWE/maxresdefault.jpg,1,29725,247,10,0,14

Let's talk more about routers and how they relate to networking. Routers are the things that connect different small area networks. I want to give a metaphor for this: I'm a teacher and I work at a school. Say I have a package that I need to get to someone who works in the district offices. I don't know where she is, I don't know where her office is located, but I know her name. I go to my secretary, like my first router, and I say \Hey, I need to get this to so-and-so at the district office, can you please help me?\ and she'll say \Sure, I don't know exactly where her office is either, but I know the next step, I can get it to the district\. So she goes on and sends it to the secretary at the district office, the next router. That secretary has no idea who I am or where I am, but she sees the name on the package and knows the end location. What I'm trying to get across here is that each router only has to know its own little network, the stops right next to it. It doesn't have to know the whole internet, but just its own connections. It can take information and say, alright, I don't know exactly where that's going, but I'll pass it along in the right direction. That's really all it takes. Routers can be different sizes, different capacities, but what they do is know their own neighborhood, take the information, and pass it in the right direction. Another thing we'll get into a little later is that the routers don't even have to have the full package of information. If one comptuer is trying to send information to another, the data might get split up between different routers and that's okay. The computers still know how to put the information back together correctly. The little pieces of information that are sent are called packets. Packets are actually little pieces of binary code (drawn on board). This is an example of what packets might look like, a visual representation of the electrical current that the computer can translate into 1's and 0's, which we all know is binary that can represent literally any digital data. These little packets are sent across through routers, and if a file is too large for one packet, it can be broken up into frames (smaller little packets). The frames don't have to take the same route to the end destination. They can take whichever route is open, whichever is fastest, and since they have the end IP address, all of the routers know where to send them. Once they get to the end destination, that computer knows how to put all of the information back together.",27,Education,PT2M54S,174,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f9M6P9IVn7k/maxresdefault.jpg,1,21127,,,0,7

You probably have even done the thing where you're at the store and you think, \Well, I can get one now, or I could wait 6 months and see how far the price has dropped\ which might sound ridiculous but this is actually a trend that's been happening for a long time. Let's talk about what makes a chip. A chip is full of these little things called transistors, which are switches that can either be a 1 or a 0 (noticing a theme here?). All of these transistors fit onto a chip, and that's how it stores information. What makes these chips larger/faster is the amount of transistors on a single chip.

Let's discuss analog vs digital on a very basic level. Most specifically, we'll talk about how computers interpret analog sound and turn it into a digital file. An analog sound wave could look like anything, but for this example it's a wavy line. The computer takes it and measures at lots of different points, turning them into numbers. This is called sampling. Later, the computer can take those numbers and turn them into sound again. Let's also discuss data compression. The benefit of compression is that it's a smaller file: it's easier to store, it's easier to send to someone else, and it just takes up less space. One of the ways this is done in sound is that the sampling is taken less often. Another way is that it takes the measurement from a median point instead of from 0, so the numbers recorded are smaller. In images, it's done by measuring groups of pixels by 16 instead of individually. The takeaway from this video is that you'll want to use digital files as they're a higher quality, and when you're looking at compression, you want to decide how far you are willing to go to ensure the user still has the best possible experience.",27,Education,PT1M39S,99,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B7seUQzZGx0/maxresdefault.jpg,1,15710,,,0,2

Let's talk about source code: what source code is, where you'll see it, and how the computer makes sense of it. Source code itself is the actual text document that the programmer creates: they type it up, it's letters, numbers, and symbols. If you give that to somebody and have them look at that document on their computer, that's not going to help them view their email, it's not going to be a browser, it's just a text document. The computer has to have a way of interpreting that and making something really powerful run from it. There are two main ways this is done: either by an interpreter or a compiler. Every browser has an interpreter, and that's how javascript is processed. Other languages, like C++, are used with a compiler. Unlike an interpreter, the compiler does all of its work on the programmer's end. They send out their package, their product, and it's already been compiled, it can already run on a machine. Javascript, however, and other interpreter languages, you just write the javascript and the browser on the user's end has the capability to interpret it so you don't need a compiler. Everyone has an opinion to which is better (interpreter or compiler), but really each has their pros and cons, and it goes on a case by case basis. They're better at different things. Now, let's focus on what open source means. Free Code Camp is open source, meaning that all of the documentation and source code is open and accessable. You may be thinking, \so what?\ but what's awesome is that if you want to change or improve Free Code Camp, you can write that improvement and maybe get it implemented. It's a great way for websites and software to grow in a strong and fast way because of the community working together to improve it. One unwritten rule of contributing to open source projects is that you should generally submit your improvements to also be open source, and by giving that improvement back to the public, you let others use your improvement as well.",27,Education,PT2M30S,150,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QHOY7PyKDh0/maxresdefault.jpg,1,38478,,,0,27

Your browser and your computer both have their own consoles. Once you become famlliar with it, you will find it to be a very useful and powerful tool. In Javascript, the console is used as a great tool for debugging and finding out where in your code there's a problem. One of the most important terms you'll need to remember is \console.log()\. The process of doing this can be put anywhere in the lines of code to help find, identify, and ultimately fix specific issues. Using the Chrome browser and the Chrome console, if we type in \console.log(\Free Code Camp rocks!\);\ the console will literally display \Free Code Camp rocks!\.

For a more in-depth explanation, check out web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm Let's talk a little more about how the internet works. We've already estabilished that every device and router on the intenet has its own IP address, which is assigned based on location. Using these IP addresses, your device can talk to your modem, then to a router, which is set up by a web service. The router would go to the domain name server, still just sending a request. That server would send back the information that was requested, and it would go back to your device. You might think this is fallable; if one step goes out, then the whole process is done. But really, there are so many routers and so many routes that if even a big chunk goes out, that still won't really affect the functionality. It's really amazing. What I want you take away from this video is that your device, since it has an IP address, can send out a request for informatoin, and that information will get back to your device via servers and routers that comprise the internet. Now, this explaination is really quite basic. For more information, check out web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm.",27,Education,PT1M29S,89,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/61dIuT4S8eg/maxresdefault.jpg,1,19053,,,0,5

In this video we talk about Data Networks. You've heard of networks, like a water network, road network, cell phone network, or television network. Today we'll talk about data networks, which are the networks that computers use. The three types we'll cover are the Local Area Network (LAN), the Wide Area Network (WAN), and the Virtual Private Network (VPN). A LAN is just a small group of computers that are connected together. The most important thing about a LAN is that those computers are close together. So, if you're using wifi at Starbucks or at your school, you're probably using a LAN that you can only connect to if you are physically close to it. A WAN (Wide Area Network) is two or more LANs that are connected over long distances. So, maybe a school in Colorado wants to connect to a school in Missouri. They could use a WAN. You might think that these are connected over the internet, and in the case of a VPN (Virtual Private Network, which is basically the same conceptionally as a WAN), you're right. However, a WAN usually rents a cable from an internet company to creat the connection.",27,Education,PT1M40S,100,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/03L0c-YMIhE/maxresdefault.jpg,1,20517,,,0,0

Today we're going to be talking more about the motherboard. We mentioned it briefly in previous videos, but we'll give some more detail today. What makes a motherboard is the connection between the CPU and the memory - if it doesn't do that, it's not a motherboard. But, most motherboards do a lot more than that. Primarily, they have expansion slots and ports. Expansion slots are where you put anything that can increase the performance of a computer without putting more load on the CPU. For example, a graphics or a sound card would up the user experience by giving better sound or video quality, but it wouldn't slow down the computer. A Network Interface Card could also go in an expansion slot. This would help your computer conncet with the networks around it, something we'll talk about more in upcoming videos. PC and Express cards are primarily found in laptops, and Express cards are taking over due to their smaller size. In addition to expansion slots, motherboards have ports. On your computer, you probably know there's a place to connect USB, firewire, SD card, ethernet, even an audio plug-in to listen through headphones. These are all considered ports, a place on the motherboard where you can connect the CPU to some outside source to either get or give information.",27,Education,PT1M51S,111,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KUmi_KBLMQY/maxresdefault.jpg,1,19220,,,0,3

The biggest type is called a super computer, a computer with lots of CPUS that work on the same problem at the same time using a technique called parallel processing. The next type is called a server. A server holds and accesses lots of data or programs. Free Code Camp is hosted on a server which stores all of that information. Let's talk now about a workstation computer - a computer that may look similar to a personal computer, but has a lot more power and is a lot pricier. Toy Story was built on workstation computers. Now, personal computers are by far the most common. Maybe you've heard \I'm a Mac!\ or \I'm a PC!\ something indicating they're different, but really my own personal MacBook is still a PC, a personal compter. It's both a Mac and a PC.

Once we start talking exponentially, that makes a really big difference. How we talk about speed really depends on what we're talking about. In audio download, we talk about kilobits per second. In internet, we use megabits per second. In network speed, we talk about Gigabits per second (one billion bits per second!). The main takeaway here is that speed is usually measured in bits and size is measured in Bytes.

After that, we've got a Nibble, which is 4 bits, which isn't common but it's adorable. The Byte, which is very common, is 8 bits. A lot of things are expressed in binary Bytes. After we get past the tiny bit and the small Byte, we get bigger really fast. The next step up is a Kilobyte, 1024 Bytes, or 1,048,576 bits. After that there's Megabyte, or 1024 Bytes to the power of two. Then it's Gigabyte, 1024 Bytes to the power of three; Terabyte, 1024 Bytes to the power of 4, and Petabyte, 1024 to the power of 5.

The next step is to take 2 to the power of whatever place it is, a 2 to the 0, 2 to the 1, all the way up to the largest placeholder. Then, all we have to do is fill in some mathamatical blanks by completing the exponential 2 problems.

Now memory can be short term memory, called RAM, or longer term memory. That's usually as a hard drive, but it can also be a CD-ROM or a flash drive, anything like that. In addition to those four basic parts, we have three more things we're going to discuss today: the motherboard, expansion cards, and power supply. The motherboard is what connects everything. While the data's flying around over here trying to figure out where to go, the motherboard helps route it so it goes to the right place. Expansion cards are sound cards, video cards, that kind of thing that can really up your experience as a user. Power supply is, as it sounds, what gets power to the computer.

These can both be any format like text, numbers, videos, images, what have you, it doesn't matter. CPU stands for central processing unit, and that's what we all think of when we think of a computer. It's what does the functions, it's what runs the software, it manipulates the data. The memory is where we store data and information. Now, the CPU has exclusive access to this memory.

We'll build our Basejumps on Cloud 9, a powerful online code editor with a full Ubuntu Linux workspace, all running in the cloud. If you don't already have Cloud 9 account, create one now at http://c9.io. Now let's get your development environment ready for a new Angular-Fullstack application provided by Yeoman. Open up http://c9.io and sign in to your account. Give your workspace a name. Choose Node.js in the selection area below the name field. Click the Create button. Click the ""Start Editing"" button. In the lower right hand corner you should see a terminal window. In this window use the following commands. You don't need to know what these mean at this point. Never run this command on your local machine. But in your Cloud 9 terminal window, run: rm -rf * && echo ""export NODE_PATH=$NODE_PATH:/home/ubuntu/.nvm/v0.10.35/lib/node_modules"" (less than symbol)(less than symbol) ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc && npm install -g yo grunt grunt-cli generator-angular-fullstack && yo angular-fullstack To finish the installation run the commands: bower install && npm install To start MongoDB, run the following commands in your terminal: mkdir data && echo 'mongod --bind_ip=$IP --dbpath=data --nojournal --rest ""$@""' (less than symbol) mongod && chmod a+x mongod && ./mongod You will want to open up a new terminal to work from by clicking on the + icon and select New Terminal Start the application by running the following command in your new terminal window: grunt serve Wait for the following message to appear: xdg-open: no method available for opening 'http://localhost:8080' . Now you can open the internal Cloud9 browser. To launch the browser select Preview in the toolbar then select the dropdown option Preview Running Application. Turn the folder in which your application is running into a Git repository by running the following commands: git init && git add . && git commit -am 'initial commit'. Now we need to add your GitHub SSH key to c9.io. Click the ""Add-on Services"" button in the lower left of your C9 dashboard. Click ""activate"" next to the GitHub icon. A pop up will appear. Allow access to your account. While still on the dashboard, under “Account Settings”, click the link for ""Show your SSH key"". Copy the key to you clipboard. Sign in to http://github.com and navigate to the GitHub SSH settings page. Click the ""Add SSH Key"". Give your key the title ""cloud 9"". Paste your SSH Key into the ""Key"" box, then click ""Add Key"". Create a new GitHub repository by and clicking on the + button next to your username in the upper-right hand side of your screen, then selecting ""New Repository"". Enter a project name, then click the ""Create Repository"" button. Find the ""...or push an existing repository from the command line"" section and click the Copy to Clipboard button beside it. Paste the commands from your clipboard into the Cloud9 terminal prompt. This will push your changes to your repository on Cloud 9 up to GitHub. Check back on your GitHub profile to verify the changes were successfully pushed up to GitHub. Now let's push your code to Heroku. If you don't already have a Heroku account, create one at http://heroku.com. You shouldn't be charged for anything, but you will need to add your credit card information to your Heroku before you will be able to use Heroku's free MongoLab add on. Before you publish to Heroku, you should free up as much memory as possible on Cloud9. In each of the Cloud9 terminal prompt tabs where MongoDB and Grunt are running, press the control + c hotkey to shut down these processes. Run the following command in a Cloud9 terminal prompt tab: npm install grunt-contrib-imagemin --save-dev && npm install --save-dev && heroku login. At this point, the terminal will prompt you to log in to Heroku from the command line. Now run yo angular-fullstack:heroku. You can choose a name for your Heroku project, or Heroku will create a random one for you. You can choose whether you want to deploy to servers the US or the EU. Set the config flag for your Heroku environment and add MongoLab for your MongoDB instance by running the following command: cd ~/workspace/dist && heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production && heroku addons:add mongolab.",27,Education,PT22M54S,1374,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HUi3aKsSKGE/maxresdefault.jpg,,260,,,0,0

Click the link to your city, then, once Facebook loads, click ""Join group"". Our local groups are new, so if you don't see your city on this list, you should follow the directions to create a Facebook group for your city. If you don't have a Facebook account, we strongly recommend you create one, even if it's just for the purpose of coordinating with campers in your city through this group. Our groups allow you to create events, coordinate those events, and share photos from the events afterward.

Learn Full-stack JavaScript, build a portfolio, and get great references with our online coding bootcamp. Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://votingapp.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku. Note that for each Basejump, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-basejumps. As you build your app, you should frequently commit changes to your codebase. You can do this by running git commit -am ""your commit message"". Note that you should replace ""your commit message"" with a brief summary of the changes you made to your code. You can push these new commits to GitHub by running git push origin master, and to Heroku by running grunt --force && grunt buildcontrol:heroku. Here are the specific User Stories you should implement for this Basejump: User Story: As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items. Bonus User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can see everyone's polls, but I can't vote on anything. Bonus User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.) Bonus User Story: As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.

Topics: 1. (00:15) Introduction to Video and to Excel.CurrentWorkbook Function, including correct definition of what Excel.CurrentWorkbook Function imports when this function is invoked. 2. (02:10) Example1: Append all Excel Tables in Current Workbook To Worksheet. We will see the Recursion Problem and solve it by filtering out the Query/Table Name. 3. (03:15) Create a Blank Query. 4. (04:10) Use Excel.CurrentWorkbook() Function as Source for Query. 5. (04:50) Use Replace feature to extract the SalesRep name from the Excel Table Name. 6. (05:38) Expand column with Excel Tables to Append all Tables into one Table. 7. (05:56) Add correct Data Types for each column 8. (06:22) Introduction to Recursion Problem, where Query will refer to itself and will double the loaded records every time a Refresh is done. And look at details of Loading Data to an Excel Worksheet after using Excel.CurrentWorkbook() Function. 9. (10:07) Solve the Recursion Problem by filtering out the Query/Table Name. 10. (11:03) Add new Excel Table to Workbook and refresh to see that new table is incorporated into Final Data Set. 11. (11:40) Look at M Code for Example #1 12. (12:20) Example2: Append all Excel Tables in Current Workbook To PivotTable Cache & make PivotTable Report. This solves the Recursion Problem because there is not a Query Load table in the Excel Worksheet as an Excel Table. 13. (12:41) Remove Excel Table that is result of Power Query Load to Worksheet by Clearing All. This process will change the Load location to Connection Only. 14. (13:38) Edit Query to Remove unneeded step and to Rename incorrectly named column. 15. (14:28) Look at M Code for Example #2 16. (15:05) Example3: Append all Excel Tables in Current Workbook that has Defined Names. 17. (15:12) Look at different objects in Excel workbook, including Excel Tables and Defined Names. 18. (17:07) Keyboard for Blank Query 19. (17:40) Use Excel.CurrentWorkbook() Function as Source for Query. Then see that this imports Excel Tables and Other Objects. 20. (17:51) Define Table Object: Set of Records for a Set of Columns/Fields. 21. (18:50) Take note that Defined Names are Imported as Tables with generic Columns Names. 22. (19:50) Learn about Table.ColumnNames Power Query Function. 23. (19:59) Filter out Filtered Database Error. 24. (20:29) Create Custom Column and use Table.ColumnNames Power Query Function to Extract Column Names from each Table in each Row. 25.

TEXTJOIN.,"Download Excel Files: https://people.highline.edu/mgirvin/YouTubeExcelIsFun/EMT1313..xlsm Download File: http://people.highline.edu/mgirvin/excelisfun.htm Formula posted by Bill Szysz. Lean how to create an Array Formula to Create Sorted Unique List in Cell. This is a huge complicated formula that requires the Excel 2016 function TEXTJOIN. There are many interesting formula elements in a single array formula to do the near impossible. Here are the topics covered (different parts that go into the final single cell formula): 1. (00:09) Problem Introduction 2. (01:43) Array of All Relative Positions & FALSEs for Unique List: using MATCH, IF and ROW functions. This is Formula Element #1. 3. (04:36) Unique Count: using previous formula element inside COUNT function. This is Formula Element #3. 4. (05:03) Array of Sequential Numbers for Unique Count: using ROW function, INDIRECT function and previous formula element. In chapter 7 of the Ctrl + Shift + Enter book, this formula element is called “Dynamic Variable-Length Array of Sequential Numbers”. Learn about the difference between using “1:” (just a row reference) and “A1:A” (a range of cells reference) (trick from Bill Szysz) in this formula element. This is Formula Element #3. 5. (06:58) Array of All Relative Positions: using SMALL function, Formula Element #1 and Formula Element #2. This is Formula Element #4. 6. (08:13) Unique List: using INDEX function, N function, IF function and Formula Element #5. 7. (09:57) Ranks (How Many Equal To or Above): using Formula Element #5, TRANSPOSE Function, Comparative Operator (to help sort), MMULT function (to add rows and convert 9 by 9 array into a single column array with the dimensions 9 by 1), Formula Element #3, and an exponent of zero (to convert all numbers to one). This is a trick I first learned from Domenic at the Mr Excel Message Board. This is Formula Element #6. 8. (16:08) Sort Relative Positions of Rank: using: MATCH function, Formula Element #3 and Formula Element #6. This is Formula Element #7. 9. (18:07) Sorted Unique List: using INDEX function, Formula Element #5 (Unique List), Formula Element #7 (Sort Relative Positions of Rank), N function, IF function and TEXTJOIN function. This is the final formula. 10. (20:30) Summary, Closing Note.",27,Education,PT20M54S,1254,2d,hd,FALSE,,1,7465,136,3,0,73

How does Data Table with Empty Cell work? Here: Data Table is a feature that copies many formulas down by substituting in a new input from the column based on a cell that is a formula input into the formula. Because the cell is an ""Empty Cell"" that is NOT a formula input in the formula being copied, Data Table tries to make a substitution, but it can't, and therefore it just copies formula down. Because it is a randomizing formula, every time it gets copied down a row, it randomizes. If you need to be reminded about how the Data Table feature works, see my earlier videos in this class here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWJPPUvJ7c8&index=5&list=PLrRPvpgDmw0mSJCZaqQPFj0eto4qnzkCZ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3komnmHvglc&index=6&list=PLrRPvpgDmw0mSJCZaqQPFj0eto4qnzkCZ Download Excel File Not: After clicking on link, Use Ctrl + F (Find) and search for “Highline BI 348 Class” or for the file name as seen at the beginning of the video.",27,Education,PT23M45S,1425,2d,hd,TRUE,,1,36650,375,5,0,61

For our example we convert Proper Data Sets in Excel to a Table and use “Add to Data Model” button in PowerPivot Ribbon Tab 3) (01:00) Excel 2016: New PowerPivot Ribbon Tab. They have renamed “Calculated Field” Button (Excel 2013) to “Measure” button (Excel 2016). We can build DAX Measures (Calculated Fields) with this new button. 4) (02:24) Step 2 for Building Data Model: Create Relationships between related tables using the “Diagram View” button in the “Manage Data Model” window. 5) (02:47) Excel 2016: New one-to-many visual presentation in the Diagram View window. We can see a line with the number one ( 1 ) next to the primary key field in the lookup table (dimension table) and an asterisk next to the Foreign Key in the Fact table. 6) (03:34) Step 3 for Building Data Model: Build DAX Calculated Column formulas. In this example we calculate Net Revenue for each transaction using the RELATED DAX function and the ROUND DAX function and a number of columns from the Fact Table. We also learn about the convention for adding columns to DAX formulas: ALWAYS use the Table Name and the Field Name (Column Name) with square brackets around it. 7) (05:56) Discussion of Implicit vs. Explicit formulas. 8) (05:56) Step 3 for Building Data Model: Build DAX Measures (Calculated Fields) formulas. In this example we will calculate Total Net Revenue using the DAX SUM function and the Calculated Column from our Fact Table. This is an explicit formula that can work efficiently with the Columnar database on big data sets. 9) (07:17) Add Number Formatting to Measure (Calculated Field) 10) (07:32) Discussion of Filter Context: The ability of the Measure (Calculate Field) to respect criteria in the PivotTable and filter the underlying table to result in a range that is smaller than the full table size and will contribute to faster formula calculation time; in essence the DAX formula and the Columnar Database work together efficiently – and much more efficiently than normal PivotTable calculations or normal spreadsheet Excel formulas. 11) (08:00) Build PivotTable from Data Model 12) (08:30) Excel 2016: New “F of X” Function Icon for Measures (Calculated Fields) in the PivotTable Field List. 13) (09:23) More discussion of Filter Context and why DAX Measures (Calculated Fields) can calculate efficiently on Big Data. 14) (09:59) Summary and Conclusion Download Excel File Not: After clicking on link, Use Ctrl + F (Find) and search for “Highline BI 348 Class” or for the file name as seen at the beginning of the video.

Why we should not use Implicit Formulas. 23) (30:02) Step 3 in Building Data Model: Build DAX Calculated Columns and Measures (Calculated Fields). This will not be an Implicit Formula. It will be an Explicit Formula. 24) (31:11) The Implicit “Sum of Net revenue” Formula shows up in Formula Field Dropdown List: DO NOT use it! 25) (31:51) Add Number Formatting to our Measures (Calculated Fields). 26) (32:05) Create PivotTable Report using our new DAX Measures (Calculated Fields). 27) (32:38) Filter Context for DAX Measures (Calculated Fields). 28) (32:58) Why we should not use Implicit Formulas AND Why we should use Explicit Formulas AND why DAX Measures (Calculated Fields) Calculate quickly on Big Data: Filter Context cause DAX Measures (Calculated Fields) to filter the underlying table so it has to process on a smaller table than the full-unfiltered table. 29) (34:59) Summary and Conclusion Download Excel File Not: After clicking on link, Use Ctrl + F (Find) and search for “Highline BI 348 Class” or for the file name as seen at the beginning of the video.",27,Education,PT36M23S,2183,2d,hd,TRUE,,1,102855,1030,22,0,82

The PowerPivot tool has the potential to revolutionize how people take big data and create reports.

Problem: one lookup value, ""Name"", that shows up as multiple duplicates in a column. 6. Therefore you have many ""matched"" row numbers that the lookup function has to deal with. 7.

All the data is so spread out that is hard to talk about 'all"" the data unless we calculate a typical value. Here are three ways to calculate a typical value: Mean, Median Mode. MEAN is the arithmetic mean (add all the scores and divide by the count). In Excel we use the AVERAGE function MEDIAN is the one in the middle (position) after we have sorted (this is good when we have extreme values like in real estate (most of the houses are around $200,000, but a few are $1,000,000)). In Excel we use the MEDIAN function MODE is the one that occurs most often. This is good when we have ""word"" categories such as preference for ""cola"". In Excel we use the MODE function (It will not tell you when there are more than 1 mode). The Standard Deviation tells you: 1) how spread out the data is; 2) what the mean deviation is; 3) does the average represent its data points fairly. In Excel we use the STDEV function for a sample and the STDEVP function for a population (population is all possible values; sample is some of the values but not all). Histogram.

Save time when creating spreadsheets by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Enter. 1) If one cell is highlighted and you type a word or formula, when you hit Ctrl + Enter, the word or formula gets put in the cell and the cell remains highlighted. This is efficient when you want to put the word or formula in the cell and then immediately do something to the cell like copy it or format it. 2) If more than one cell is highlighted and you type a word or formula in the active cell, when you hit Ctrl + Enter, all the cells are populated with the word or formula. This is true even if you have non-contiguous cells highlighted. Active Cell is the cell in the highlighted range that is a light color Non-contiguous cells means cells that are not right next to each other; example A1:A3, C2:D4. If you want to edit a bunch of formulas that are all the same, highlighting the whole range, hitting F2 to put the active cell formula into edit mode, editing the formula, and then hitting Ctrl + Enter is efficient",28,Science & Technology,PT6M26S,386,2d,sd,FALSE,,1,21117,102,3,0,15

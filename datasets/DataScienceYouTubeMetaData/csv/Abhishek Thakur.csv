Bio: Valdimir is Sr. Computer Vision Engineer at Lyft, Ph.D. Physics, Veteran of The Russian Airborne Forces, Kaggle Grandmaster Vladimir got his Ph.D. in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics at UC Davis. After graduation he was developing Energy Disaggregation algorithms that were a combination of the signal processing and machine learning techniques, working as a data scientist at Bidgely. After this, he moved to San Francisco to work in TrueAccord where he was mainly focussed on building recommender systems. Currently, Vladimir is applying Deep Learning techniques to the computer vision problems at the Lyft's Level5 Engineering Centre that is focussed on the development of the self-driving cars. #MachineLearning #DeepLearning #MaskDetection ------ Please subscribe and like the video to help me keep motivated to make awesome videos like this one. :) To buy my book, Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning problem, please visit: https://bit.ly/buyaaml Follow me on: Twitter: https://twitter.com/abhi1thakur LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhi1thakur/ Kaggle: https://kaggle.com/abhishek Instagram: https://instagram.com/abhi4ml",27,Education,PT1H9M47S,587,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VAg8pMJRbgA/maxresdefault.jpg,,2903,203,3,0,14

Abstract: #DeepLearning has set up new benchmarks for Computer Vision, NLP, Speech, Reinforcement Learning in the past few years. However tabular data competitions are still dominated by gradient boosted trees (GBTs) libraries like XGBoost, LightGBM and Catboost. Tabnet is a new promising deep learning architecture based on sequential attention transformers proposed by Arik & Pfister that aims to fill the gap between GBTs and neural networks. Pytorch-tabnet is an open source library that provides a scikit-like interface for training a TabNetClassifier or TabNetRegressor. It's ease of use allow any developer to quickly try a #TabNet architecture on any dataset, hopefully setting up new benchmarks.

This where text is used as both an input and an output for solving all types of tasks. I believe that the combination of text-to-text as a universal format for NLP tasks paired with multi-task learning (single model learning multiple tasks) will have a huge impact on how NLP deep learning is applied in practice. In this presentation I aim to give a brief overview of #T5, explain some of its implications for NLP in industry, and demonstrate how it can be used for sentiment span extraction on tweets. Speaker Bio: Lorenzo Ampil is a Machine Learning Product Manager and Data Scientist at Thinking Machines, a global AI consulting firm w/ operations in Singapore and Manila. He specializes in developing products that utilize deep learning and machine learning on NLP for various industries. Prior to this, he set up his own consulting practice where he provided end-to-end data science solutions for finance and tech companies in Southeast Asia and Australia. He also previously worked at Uber as an analyst, where he handled projects related to NLP, analytics, and automation for the APAC region’s community operations. ------ If you want to be a speaker and talk about your #MachineLearning #DeepLearning Projects, then please fill out this form: https://bit.ly/AbhishekTalks Follow me on: Twitter: https://twitter.com/abhi1thakur LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhi1thakur/ Kaggle: https://kaggle.com/abhishek",27,Education,PT1H1M21S,81,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4LYw_UIdd4A/maxresdefault.jpg,,3104,172,0,0,25

The world is getting more complex, and so are the global challenges facing us. The recent coronavirus spread is one example of a global challenge that escalated fast, and there are other potential ones such as water crisis and ecological disasters. The best way to tackle these challenges is for us to understand the true nature of the problem, the different components that are involved, and the roles of different stakeholders before we can build effective solutions. Business architects have traditionally addressed challenges within the enterprise by using some tools and techniques that follow a structure or template. But now we need to start looking outside the enterprise at the whole ecosystem, which might include the entire world so we can help those in positions of power and responsibility to direct resources effectively and make the right decisions. In this video, we use the coronavirus challenge to illustrate an approach for decision-making, based on principles of structured thinking. The intent is not to be comprehensive but to give you an idea of how one would even start to look at such challenges, but at the same time provide something of value. Many of these global challenges can benefit from using business architecture principles, tools and methodologies as a strong foundation to develop effective solutions. But the consumers of these solutions don't necessarily care about the discipline. With this in mind, we have simplified the terminology, so it becomes easy enough for a high school graduate level student to understand the thinking process and buys into the approach – which in this case is the COVID Perimeter Framework. ------------------ Here's what I can do to help you.

I want to share with you the high-level architecture of a real enterprise-class AI platform that I'm architecting. First, here's some context. My dad wanted me to become a doctor - a noble profession that helps saves lives. My interest, though, lay more in engineering. Little would I have imagined that one day, I'll be architecting a platform, build it out with the help of a fabulous team, and in the process positively impact the lives of not just a few, but potentially millions of people. It is with deep humility that I share this work with you. The company I'm working with is DataFoundry.ai. Our goal is to leverage both structured and unstructured data in the healthcare and life sciences space to get medicines to market faster! Today a lot of the processing is manual, slow, error-prone, and expensive. AI is a great technology that can automate many aspects of the end-to-end clinical trial process - from documents to automating tasks, making intelligent decisions, and getting smarter over time as the system learns. The AI platform is architected on a strong foundation that is secure, scalable, distributed, robust, and modular. With this foundation, we can bring drugs to market faster, meet stringent regulatory requirements, and even catch adverse drug reactions that happen even after the drug hits the market. Such a process would not have been possible without AI technologies. The flexible platform lets us build solutions that can adapt to future needs. Of course, development requires us to use methodologies like CICD, Agile, etc., and the use of AI/ML adds more complexity in terms of explain-ability, track and trace, model archiving, model updates, etc - things that I have discussed in my previous AI videos. ------------------ On a personal note, I speak, write, and consult on the topics of AI and architecture.

A HBR study states that 80% of such mergers and acquisitions will fail. How can we ensure that these mergers are successful? In this video, we offer an option - use models. — script —— Last year has seen lot of mergers and acquisitions – around $2.4 trillion. To get an idea of how much money this is, if you stack up a $2.4 trillion in $100 bills, it will stretch from Washington DC to Denver! These M&As were to done for various reasons: (1) tax avoidance in the US, (2) crushing the competition, and (3) complementing capabilities to grow. Let’s talk more about the third reason. The merger itself is a business decision – but what needs to follow is a plan on the mechanics of how the merger will happen. Functional areas have to be merged, business processes merged, people reallocated, IT systems made to work with one another, and so on, all while preserving the combined company's competitive advantage and leveraging their respective strengths. This is tough. According to a HBR study, failure rate of mergers and acquisitions is about 80%. In 2008 Bank of America was forced to rescue Merrill Lynch for $44 billion, but that was painful at best, with long lasting implications, including the CEO of BOA at the time, Ken Lewis, losing his job. The cultural clash was one of the main problems. In 2004 Commere One, a high-flying internet company filed for bankruptcy after an acquisition failure. The company had many applications running on different platforms and technologies. Customers wanted to integrate across those applications. So Commerce One acquired a platform company. However integration with the platform was difficult to accomplish, leading to the company's demise. How you want to integrate the two businesses depends on your intent. To improve your current business’ effectiveness, you could dissolve the acquired company and fold its resources into the main business. Cisco’s folding of Webex for its technology in 2007 was a great success, while Chrysler’s acquisition of Daimler’s in 1998 was a colossal failure though both did similar things. Why? At the time of acquisition, Chrysler’s whole system was modular, and could reconfigured pretty quickly. Daimler’s system however we monolithic. Integrating the two was too difficult at multiple levels – people, process, technology and culture. Leaders needs to use models as a basis to understand the impacts and implications of mergers and how to design the new organization. Models can help to answer questions like.. - What are the areas of critical focus? - How do we retain competitive advantage? - How to scale? - How to identify the need for new capabilities? etc Models drive successful mergers and acquisitions.",27,Education,PT3M27S,207,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EWNZa4s0vlU/maxresdefault.jpg,1,34358,205,12,0,11

This mode of funding is ineffective because it does not consider the enterprise implications. Sometimes a ‘low priority’ project may be the critical link in the achieving end-to-end customer value. So what do you do about it? This video explains…. Transcript: Typically, a company’s funding model is aligned to its organizational structure. For example, different functional areas – such as sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, etc. each gets a slice of the enterprise budget. Each area submits a list of projects, and the budget for those projects. The executives sit around a table and go through each areas projects and proposals, prioritizing them. Each project is considered in isolation. After some extended discussions, again all in isolation, the year’s budget is allocated to some of the projects. This causes huge problems which is not even noticed by the executives. There is no mechanism to understand the dependencies across. In one large telecommunications company, a huge marketing strategy project was approved. As the year progressed, this project was a great success – with many customers calling in to purchase the products being offered. However, since the corresponding product development project was shuttled, only a few customers could actually buy products advertised by marketing. This resulted in bad publicity and loss of business. What would have helped the executives make better funding decisions? A framework that enables them to look across all projects holistically and make funding decisions from an enterprise perspective. An overall corporate goal will drive the funding decisions instead of each project being evaluated in isolation. For this, dependencies across projects need to be identified. In this picture, the circle size indicates the funding required, and the colors indicate original priority. A project that may have been originally a low priority may become critical because it helps in achieving the overall corporate goal. Without knowing such dependency, the project may never have got funded. At one grocery chain, delivery of groceries to customers was designated to be important. Many areas were individually funded, but not enough money was allocated to the transportation area to be able to conduct repairs quickly since that was a low priority project when considered in isolation. This broke the “chain” and the company was not able to deliver groceries to its customers effectively. A simple framework can show cross dependencies. Of course, this can get fancier as we try to understand more about the projects, dependencies, and ownership. On your next funding cycle, build a framework that’ll help identify and talk through the dependencies across projects so funding decisions can be made from an enterprise perspective and not in isolation.",27,Education,PT3M2S,182,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b3lyORd44fM/maxresdefault.jpg,1,634,13,0,0,0

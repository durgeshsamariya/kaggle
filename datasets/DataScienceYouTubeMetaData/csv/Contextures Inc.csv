We could do that on the worksheet with a formula, and we'll do it here first, and then use the same formula in conditional formatting. In this cell I'm going to type an equal sign. I want to check two things. So I'm going to use the AND function and an open bracket. The first thing I want to check is if this cell B4 is greater than or equal to this cell. B4 greater than, equal to, and the start date. Now it's gone in as a relative reference, but no matter which row I'm checking, I always want it to check this cell. I'm going to press the F4 key, to put dollar signs in there, and make that an absolute reference. Then I'll type a comma and the next thing I want to check is if B4 is less than or equal to the end date. B4 less than equal to. Click on the end date and again press F4, to lock that and make it an absolute reference to that cell. Close the bracket and press Enter. Now this one is not in that date range, but if I drag down, and we've got a few more dates here, going down to the beginning of April, we can see that these are all TRUE and they're from January 17th to February 14th. If I look at that count down here, we've got 8. We're going to use this same formula in the conditional formatting rule that we'll set up. So I've selected the first cell, I want to be in the first row. I'll highlight that in the formula bar, Ctrl+C to copy it. Then press Enter, to get out of the edit mode in that cell. I'm going to click the heading of the Date column, to select all the date cells. Then up on the Home tab, Conditional Formatting. New Rule. In here, I want to use a formula. We're going to use that formula that we just copied and I'll click in the format values, formula cell, and Ctrl+V to paste that formula. I'm going to click Format, and on the Font tab, I'm just going to make a subtle change to the color. That way, if we wanted to print this sheet, nobody would notice that there is a difference in some of the cells. So instead of Automatic, which right now is black, I'm going down to this last one, which is Black Text, 1 Lighter 5%. I'll click OK and we can see the formatting example here. Click OK and now we don't really see any difference here, but if I go to that drop down arrow, now there's a Filter by Color option. Filter by Font Color, and it shows in the filtered results, just the ones where we have the TRUE. And it's got the same 8 count that we had before. To clear that, I've got a shortcut up on my Quick AccessToolbar. Now all the records are showing again, We can clear out this list of formulas that we entered. Now if I want to look at from January 1st to February 15th. I can go back to my Filter by Color, and it now includes all of the dates in this new date range. without having to go in and change the settings in the filter Between that we did before. .",27,Education,PT6M46S,406,2d,hd,TRUE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qCD1iN5GsM4/maxresdefault.jpg,1,6507,82,2,0,9

The first one, for produce type, fruit or vegetable. In the next column, there's a dependent dropdown list, it will change based on what you selected in the other column. Here it shows a list of vegetables. If I go to next row and select fruit, Column C shows list of fruit. Here's a new workbook where we're going to set up dropdown lists. We've got 2 sheets. One is Data Entry, other one is called Lists. Start a new blank workbook and name the 2 sheets. I typed Produce Type and Item on this sheet, where we're going to create dropdown lists. On the other sheet, I've got 3 lists set up, Produce List with Fruit and Vegetable, and a fruit list, and vegetable list, with 4 vegetables. The produce list is our main list. We have 2 items, and it's important to use a one-word name in this list for each produce type. We'll those names later, and Excel won't allow spaces. Each list will be changed to a formatted Excel table. In the first one, click anywhere in the list. On the Home tab, go to Format as Table, select a format that you like. My list is B2 to B4, and has a header. Click OK, and there's our formatted list. It has a dropdown list in the header cell, to filter or sort, and a corner tab here to change the size of this table. If we add new items, the table automatically expands to include them. We'll do the same thing for the fruit and vegetable list. Click anywhere in this list, Format as Table. Select a color. Again, it has headers. And same for vegetable, green, has header. The next step is name cells with items in each list. Select cells B3 and B4, with produce type names, and to name these 2 cells, click the Name Box. Type a one-word name, Produce, then press Enter, to complete the name. It still shows Table1, but click the arrow to see Produce. Give the fruit list a name, it has to be an exact match for the item in this produce list. Select these 4 cells, click in Name Box, type fruit, press Enter. Upper or lower case doesn't matter, as long as spelling is the same. Now we have a fruit list, do the same here, this will be called Vegetable, press enter. Now we can see all 3 names, Fruit, Produce, and Vegetable, and table names. Next, set up the data entry sheet. I've got headings entered, and I'll create a table from these 2 cells, then add items in rows below. With a heading cell selected, on Home tab, Format as Table, select style you like. Again, my table has headers, OK. It creates a table with one blank row below headings. We'll set up a very simple dropdown in this cell, where we can select a produce types, fruit or vegetable. Go to Data tab, click data validation, on Settings tab, select List. For source, we'll use our produce list. On a Windows computer, press F3 key, to see names you've created. Click Produce, OK, it puts in an = and the name of that range. If you don't have that shortcut, type =produce, click OK. Now we've got a dropdown arrow when this cell is selected, select fruit or vegetable. In this cell, we'll create dropdown that depends on what we selected. If Fruit is selected, it will show fruit list, if we chose Vegetable, we'll only see vegetables. To create this dropdown, on Data tab, click Data Validation. We want a list, and this time, we'll use a formula. Type =. The function we're going to use in this formula is INDIRECT, then click an open bracket. We want to use whatever name has been selected, so type B3, close that bracket. Instead of typing fruit or vegetable, we'll use INDIRECT function to get name that we want to use from cell B3, and create a reference to that list, click OK. It will create a list based on that produce type. Select lemon. Go to next row and type fruit again, it shows fruit list. Change to vegetable, it shows list of vegetables. So this is dependent dropdown list. We create a main dropdown, then a dependent dropdown- items in that list depend on cell we told it to look at.

The example is on the DupRules sheet in the sample workbook. In Excel, you can use the conditional formatting to highlight one or more cells, based on rules. In this example, the conditional formatting rules are duplicated automatically, when rows are inserted or deleted in the table. This can cause a huge mess of rules in the workbook, with many duplicates. Your workbook could slow down in some cases. See how to remove the duplicates quickly, and get back to just the original set of rules. 00:00 Introduction 00:18 The Conditional Formatting Rules 01:06 Insert a New Row 01:59 Fix the Duplicate Rule Problem - Step 1 02:28 Fix the Duplicate Rule Problem - Step 2 02:58 Get the Sample File '------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TRANSCRIPT FOR THE VIDEO In this workbook, I've got a couple conditional formatting rules, and I'm going to show you how those can get duplicated, so you end up with lots more rules than you started out with, and then how you can fix the problem. So in this table I have two rules. --One puts a line at the top of a date, if it's different from the date above. --The other rule changes the price to green, if it's greater than $500 dollars. We'll take a look at those rules. In the Home tab, go to Conditional Formatting, Manage Rules. And there you can see the two rules. They're each applied from row 3 to 19 in this table. --Now this one is just a cell value greater than 500. --And this one is referring to a couple of cells. So if A2 is different from A3, we're going to put a blue line, at the top of the cell. And now, I'm going to insert a row, because I forgot to put in one of the records here. So I'll click, Insert. And then just put some data in this row. So that was a simple change to the table. And now I'm going to go back and look at my conditional formatting rules again. And suddenly I have a new rule, just for the row that I inserted. So row 11 has its own rule, and the previous rule is still there, going from A3 to E10, and then A12 to E20. So it's skipping this row, because that row has a separate rule. And if you insert lots of rows, you can end up with hundreds of these rules set up, without even knowing it. And what I do to fix it is select all the rows, except for the first one. Then go to Conditional Formatting, Clear Rules, From Selected Cells. Now if I go back in, and Manage Rules...I'll go back to This Worksheet, just so we can see everything. So we're back to those two original rules. Then, I select the first row. I'll select the first row in the table, this time, instead of the whole worksheet. And go to the Format Painter, and make sure you're selecting this first row as well, and apply that formatting to all the rows again. And when we go back to Manage Rules, we still just have those two original rules.",27,Education,PT3M10S,190,2d,sd,TRUE,,1,22634,112,10,0,38

I'll show you how that works and then we can look at the code quickly in the background. This is the menu sheet and there's a cell here that has a drop down list. If I click that, I can see, Computer, P&L and ALL. I'll click on Computer and now we just have the menu sheet showing and the two sheets that had computer in their names. I'll do the same for P&L, so there are the two sheets that are P&L and now I'll go back to looking at all the sheets and all the sheets, the admin sheets and instructions and everything is visible now. To set this up, we have a data validation drop down list here, if I go to the data tab, data validation, we can see that there's a list and it's based on sheet types. So I'll close that and that sheet types is on this admin list, I've just entered three items here, I typed all and I left a space character at the beginning of that, just so if I sort this list, that item will always go up to the top, so it's easy to find. Then once the list was entered on this sheet, I created a table from that, so on the home tab, you can format as a table and select one of these styles for it and that means that now if I put another item at the bottom of this list, the list will expand automatically, we can see that the list is now grown and I can sort this. And now if I go back to the menu, we've got admin and that just shows any sheet that has admin in its name. So it's a quick way to work with your sheets if you want to either see a whole lot of them or just a small selection of your sheets so you can focus on those. The sheets that are visible, change because a macro runs, if we make a change in this cell and to see that code, I'm going to right click on the menu tab, view code, and here is the worksheet change event. So it's going to look at the target and that's the changed cell. If the address of that cell is the same as the select type address and if we look at this cell, and look up in the name box here, that cell is named selecttype. If we've changed that cell, then we're going to see what the value of the target cell is. If we select it all, you can see this space there, it's going to run a macro called, showallsheets. If we just clear out that cell, then nothing's going to happen, we can't show sheets if we don't have the text that's in the name of those sheets. And, if they didn't select all or the cell isn't empty, then it's case else, so for every other situation, we're going to run a macro called, ShowSelSheets. To see those macros, I'm going to right click here, definition, and that takes us here into module 1 and we can see the ShowAllSheets and there's a variable, ws, which is a worksheet. So for each worksheet in the active workbook sheets, that worksheet, visible property is visible. So every sheet becomes visible and for the other macro, ShowSelSheets, we again have a variable for the worksheet and one for the string, the str type, so whatever type we've selected here on the menu sheet in that select type range, so whatever that value is, that's what we're going to be looking for. For each worksheet, in the ActiveWorkbook sheets, if we can find that name, so the strType in the worksheet name and we're using the InStr, the in string function for that, so if it does find that string in the name, then the sheet is visible, otherwise, unless the sheet is named, menu, we want to leave that visible, then that sheet will be hidden. Those are the two different macros that will run based on making a change here.",27,Education,PT5M16S,316,2d,hd,TRUE,,1,50821,295,11,0,32

For example, right-click a column heading, and click Insert, to add a new column. Unfortunately, the commands that you use most often might not be on those popup menus. Instead, you have to use keyboard shortcuts, or use the commands on the Excel Ribbon. However, there is a free Excel add-in that you can use, to customize those right-click menus. Add the commands that you do want, and remove the commands that you don't need. You can download the MenuRighter add-in from the YourSumBuddy website, at this URL: http://yoursumbuddy.com/menurighter/ Then, install the add-in, and there are instructions on my website, if you're not sure how to do that. The MenuRighter add-in appears as a command on the Developer tab of the Excel Ribbon.

Split Date With Formulas The first one will use a formula. So in here I'm going to click and type an equal sign. We'll use the INT function, which is for an integer and that is going to pull the whole number from this cell, which is just the date part of the date and time. When I press Enter we'll see a date. Now if you see a number, you can format that as a date. Then I can select that cell, double-click on the Fill Handle, and I very quickly have all the dates. Get Time With Formula If a date has a time attached to it, that's a decimal number. So if it's 12 noon, it would be the date number 0.5. So we want to just get that decimal portion, so we'll type equals the date. So that's the full member including the decimal. And then minus the date portion, we want to subtract that full number. So we'll use the INT bracket and click on the date. And when I press Enter, we get the time. And again, you might have to format that as time, if you're just seeing a number. And then fill that down. Split Date Without Formulas We can also pull this out without a formula. So here's another copy of the same list. And in here I'm going to just type the first two dates. So I'll type 2/1/16 and 2/3/16. And now we're going to use the Flash Fill. And if you're doing this with text, it would fill down automatically, usually, once we set a pattern, but for numbers or dates, it doesn't do that. We can go to the Data tab, and click Flash Fill, and then it will suggest the rest of the dates for you. And then you can come here and accept or undo or just leave it as is if you want to accept it. Get Time Without Formula And we can do the same thing for the time. So I'll type the first couple, and 9:32 And now again, I'll go and click Flash Fill, and it fills down the rest and they look fine to me. So I'll leave those as is. Now those won't change if these dates change.

We'll see how to fix that. Here is a very small sample of a bank account. We've got cheque numbers and the amount of each cheque. To create a total, I can go to the Home tab, and over at the right, click AutoSum. And usually, that will select any numbers above, but in this case it didn't, so I will manually select those, and press Enter, and it shows zero. So even though I've got hundreds of dollars, it's showing zero. I'm going to add a couple of other functions on this worksheet, and just find out what's going on in these cells. In this cell, I'm going to get a count of everything that's in those cells, whether it's text or numbers. In here, I'm going to use COUNTA equals COUNTA open bracket. Then I'll select the cells that have the numbers, close the bracket, and press Enter. These four cells have something in them. But how many of those have numbers? And to do that here we use COUNTA. And in this cell, I'm going to use COUNT, and it only counts numbers. So equals COUNT open bracket, select the four cells again, close the bracket, and press Enter. We have four cells with something in them, but none of those cells have numbers. If I look at one of these cells and look up in the Formula Bar, I can see the number, but in front of the number there's an apostrophe, and that indicates that this is text rather than a number. So, whatever we've downloaded or copied in from somewhere came in as text. There is a quick way we can fix this, though. We're going to select a blank cell, and then use paste special to paste it over these numbers, and it will add a zero to everything, which won't have any effect on these values, but will change them from text to numbers with that simple step. I'll select a blank cell and copy. Then select the cells that I want to fix, and go up to Paste, click the drop-down arrow, and go down to Paste Special. And in here, I want to Add, so I'll select that. Click OK. And now, these have all changed to numbers, and we can see a total at the bottom. I could format these so that they all line up nicely. I could format this one, as well. And now, we have a total that's correct and nicely formatted.",28,Science & Technology,PT3M25S,205,2d,hd,TRUE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h8543MwnnTs/maxresdefault.jpg,1,179640,511,68,0,100

In this pivot table, I'm showing orders. One of the products we sell is paper. I entered a new order, and it's not showing up here. If I refresh, it's not picking up that new record. I'm going to find the source data and see if there's a problem. To find the source data, select a cell in the pivot table. On the Ribbon, under Pivot Table Tools, click Analyze. Click here, and here's the Change Data Source. That opens up the Change PivotTable Data Source window. It's showing that there's a range selected, and I can see moving lines in the background, and one row is not included. It stops at row 9 and the new record is row 10. To change this and fix the problem, I can adjust the range that's included here. Back space, and type 10, instead of 9. Or I can select and delete it. Then on the worksheet, select the range that I want to use. Click OK, and the pivot table shows the new data. You could continue to adjust that range as you add new rows to the data source. But a better solution is to create a dynamic source for your pivot table, which will adjust automatically, if you add new records. It's easy to do that, in Excel 2007 or later. Go back to the Orders sheet. This is just a list typed on the worksheet. We've got column headings and a row for each order, but if I look on the ribbon, there's no Table tab at the top. We're going to create a named table. To create the table, select a cell in your list and on the Ribbon click Insert, Table. It does a good job of detecting the range, but if necessary, you can adjust what's typed in here. Be sure to check My Table Has Headers, then click OK. You'll get a formatted table. Click on one cell. To change the formatting that it puts on the table, go to the Design tab, under the Table tab, and select something else. The next thing you should do is change the name of the table. It will give a default name that ends with a number. Just select that and I'm going to call this tbl, for table, tblOrders, and press Enter. So now we have a table name, and I can see that name, if I go to the Formulas tab, Name Manager. And there's a list of all the names in this workbook. So it makes it easy to spot this, if you have several tables in your workbook. I'll close this, and the next step will be to use our name, so going back to the Table Tools, we're going to use this name, tblOrders, as our source for the pivot table. I'm going to just click in here, and then Ctrl+ C to copy that name. I'll go back to my pivot table now. And then with a cell selected in the pivot table, I'll go back to the Analyze tab, click Change Data Source, and here's the current data source. I'm going to use Ctrl+ V to paste what I copied as the table name. So it's now going to use this dynamic range which will adjust as we add new records. Click OK, and nothing looks different here, but I'm going to go and add another order. Just copy what we have above, by using Ctrl and the double quote. I'll put in 100, so now we should see 320, where we had 220 before. Going back to Pivot Sales, it still says 220. I'll refresh, and now we've got 320. So I didn't have to adjust the range of the pivot table source data. That adjusted automatically, because it's a named table. So if your pivot table data will change frequently, make sure you use a dynamic source, like a named Excel table, and it will adjust as you add or delete records.",28,Science & Technology,PT6M8S,368,2d,hd,TRUE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_eD8H6hw5vI/maxresdefault.jpg,1,51856,149,7,0,19

So we'll see how we can set up a pivot table to summarize the data and then a pivot chart that shows the years. Here's a sheet with all the raw data. We've got it set up as an Excel table. Each work order has a number and we can see the request date and the date the work was done. First step will be to create a pivot table from this data, to summarize things. Click anywhere in this table, and on the Insert tab, I'll click Pivot Table. This list is a formatted Excel table, a named table, so we can see that it's picked up the name automatically. And so if we add new records, this will expand to include those. And I'd like this chart on an existing worksheet. I'll click in here, click this box. I would like it on ServiceChart1, cell A3. Close that, click.OK. So here's the empty pivot table, and I'm going to put in the work date, and then I'll put the work order into the values and it will show up as a count. So now we have everything summarized by date and I'm going to create a chart to see how it looks now. So go back to the Insert tab. I'll click Pivot Chart, and it's suggesting a column chart, but I would like a line, and I'd like this type of line and I'll click OK. And it's put in a very bumpy line chart for me. So it's charting each day, and I would like it by month and year. So I'm going to have to group the dates. Right now, all the dates are listed individually, so I'll right click on a date and Group. I'd like them grouped by years and months, so I'll select both of those, click OK, and now the chart looks much better. It's showing a single line, and we can see the months across the bottom, 2013 followed by 2014. We'd like to compare year to year though, so I need to create a single line for each year. And to do that, I'm going over to the pivot table field list and I can see Years and Work Date, here in the rows. And to get two separate lines, I'm going to drag Years up into columns, and when I let go, it creates a line for each year. So that's the layout we want. You can do a couple of other things, to make this a little easier to read, and more appealing to look at. So here where it says Count of Work Order, if I go to the pivot table and type Work Orders, and I press Enter, that shows up in the pivot chart as well.

In the Pivot Table, it would be ideal if I could drag region into values and see a region name, but that doesn't happen. It shows a count of the region. I'll remove that. We'll use this Region ID, and regions are numbered. East is 1, Central is 2, and West is 3. In the pivot, I'm going to add Region ID, and because it's numeric, it goes right into the Values area. But it's showing SUM. I want to be see numbers 1, 2 and 3 in here, and then I'll work with those. I'll right click, Summarize Values By, and I could use Max or Min, to get a unique number for each region. I'll use Max. Now we can see those Region IDs. We're halfway there. I'll turn off grand totals because we don't need those. On the Design tab, Grand Totals, Off for Rows and Columns. Now we just have region numbers. To change these numbers into text, we'll use number formatting and I'll use conditional formatting to find what number is in the cell, and then use the number format based on the cell value. I'll select all the cells that have the values, and on the Home tab, click Conditional Formatting, New Rule. Apply Rule To is currently showing the address of the range I have selected, which is B5 to H10. We can see here that B5 is the active cell. We don't want to confine this to a specific address because perhaps later we'll add new cities or stores, so we want this to be expandable. I'm going to click the third choice, All Cells Showing Max of RegID Values for City and Store. I'm going to use a formula to decide which cells should be formatted. In the first case, we're going to be formatting any cells that have a 1, and that's the East region. Here I'm going to say =B5 and that's the active cell. That's what we use in our formula, =1. Anywhere there's a cell that has a 1, we're going to format that. Click the Format button. In here, under the Category, click Custom. Now we can create our own format. We want any cell that equals one. In square brackets, type =1, close the square bracket. And for that, we want it to say East. Inside double quotes, type East. That will format any positive numbers. Then we'll type two semi-colons because we don't care about the formatting for any negative numbers or zeros. We'll just leave those blank and click OK, and OK. And the cells that had a 1 in them now change to East. We're going to repeat that for numbers 2 and 3. Going back into Conditional Formatting, New Rule, All cells showing Max of RegID for city and store. Use a formula, and in this case we say =B5=2. Again, click Format, Custom. This time, we're going to do the 2. In square brackets, =2. And this time it is the Central. In double quotes, type Central, two semi-colons, click OK, and OK. They're just a little too narrow. Make those columns wider. And the third number here is for the West region. So I'll do that step. Make sure I have all the cells selected, conditional formatting, new rule, all cells. Formula, =B5=3. Format, custom, square bracket =3 West, two semi-colons, OK, OK. And there, we have all of them formatted. It looks like we've typed text or made text show in here and that's all done with number formatting through conditional formatting. This would be rather tedious if you have lots of values. But if you only have a few, it's a way to show text in your Pivot Table.",28,Science & Technology,PT6M26S,386,2d,hd,TRUE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wslp2BqHuz8/maxresdefault.jpg,1,250183,554,56,0,96

If you need a pie chart, create a simple one, without special effects such as 3-D. Then format the data labels, so data is easy to understand.

It might be easier to compare the values, if you create a bar chart such as this one, which easily shows the difference between each region, or in a column chart like this one. But if you need to create a pie chart, we'll see the steps for creating one that's easy to read, and presents the data as clearly as possible. The first step is to set up the data. On this sheet, I have the names of four regions, and in the column to the right,the numbers which represent the sales in each of those regions. A pie chart can only show one set of numbers, so we couldn't compare year to year for each region, but we can see the total sales for the current year. To create the chart, I'm going to select any cell in this table, and on the Ribbon, I'll go to the Insert tab, and click Pie And I'm going to select this first pie chart, which is just a simple pie chart. I don't want an exploded pie or a pie of pie and certainly not a 3D pie, because those can distort the data, with the way that they create angles. I'm going to click this one and it puts a chart right in the middle of the worksheet. You can move it, and you can resize it, and to move it just point to one of the borders or point somewhere. You'll notice where I'm pointing, a pop up says Chart Area. So if I point there, I can drag it to the right or left. And I can also make it smaller, by pointing to one of the handles on the sides or in the corner. Pull the handle in or pull it out to make it bigger. We have colored slices on this pie and a legend tells us what each color represents. To read that, people have to look at the color here, and then try and find it in the legend. So it's better if you have these labels right on the slices, or just beside them. We're going to get rid of this legend, and put data labels onto the pie. Now this pie only has four slices. You shouldn't try to show too much in a pie chart, or it'll just get so crowded you won't even be able to read it. So with this pie chart, I'm going to right click, and click Add Data Labels, and that puts the value. We can see the values here, and it's just put that on each slice. So it's a start. It's not telling us what region it is yet, but we're going to fix that up in a minute. Next I'll delete this legend, because we're not going to need it. I'll right-click on the legend, and click Delete, and that shifts the pie over into the center. And now we have a little more room to put things onto the slices. I'll right click on one of these labels and Format Data Labels. In this Format Data Labels window, Label Options is selected, and I have check boxes that I can use to put things onto the label. I don't want to put too much, or it'll just be crowded and hard to read. Right now, it's showing the value. I could also add the percentage. For this slice, it shows 400 as the value, and 35% of the total value. I would also like to see the region name, so I'll check Category, and I'm going to take out the value and just leave it with the region name and the percentage. I can also position those labels. Right now, it came up, the default is Best Fit, so it will put that label where it has most amount of room. You could put them in the center of each slice, the inside end, outside or best fit, and I'll close this window. Now I'm going to do a little more formatting on these labels, so they're easier to read. I'll right click, and in this Formatting ribbon, I'm going to choose a white font, because it will provide a better contrast with the dark background. I'll make those labels bold and maybe go up a little in size, so you can experiment. As I point to each size, it shows what it will look like. So 12 might be a little too big. Maybe go with 11. Now you've got a pie chart where everything's easy to read. The labels are right on the slice, so you don't have to look back and forth from a legend to try and figure things out, so it's a good representation of the data.",28,Science & Technology,PT4M49S,289,2d,hd,FALSE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fnE-Yq771nM/maxresdefault.jpg,1,243800,831,80,0,59

Here we can see region and it's only listed once, and then blank to the end of the region, and the employees in each region. You might have one or multiple employees, but again, blank below those employee names. This is fine for reading the list, but if you want to work with the data, perhaps filter it or sort things, then you need to fill in these blank cells. Here's a quick way to do that. First, we'll select columns A and B where there are blanks. Then on the Ribbon's Home tab, go to Find & Select, Go To Special. In the Go To Special window, click Blanks, and then click OK. All the blank cells are selected now and we're going to put in a very simple formula that just says get the value from the cell above. Type an equal sign and then press the up arrow on your keyboard. You can see the formula here now has changed to A2. To fill that formula into all the selected cells, press the Ctrl key and then tap Enter. That puts that same formula into all the selected cells. Now we want to change these formulas to values so that we can move things around without having the values change. I'm going to select columns A and B where we filled the blanks and then point to the border of what is selected. You'll see a four-headed arrow there. Press the right button on the mouse and drag slightly to the right. Then drag right back to where you started. Let go of the right mouse button, and the pop up menu has some choices. Click Copy Here As Values Only.

Here we have a table with sales records. We can see where things were sold, what we sold, and how much and how much money we got on each sale. We can scroll down and see row after row of data. Now I could create formulas to summarize things, but with a pivot table it will just be a few clicks to get totals. In Excel 2013 it's easier than ever to create a pivot table because there's a new tool to help you with some suggested arrangements for your data. I'm going to click any cell in this table. On the Insert tab, at the left, there's a Tables group and here's the new tool, which is Recommended Pivot Tables. I'll click that. It opens up a new window, and based on the data that I've got here, it's suggesting some layouts So the first one is showing the cities and then taking the total price and giving me the total sales in each city. That might be useful if I'm interested in where things are selling. If we want to know what's selling, here's a layout that has the different product categories and then for each region how much we sold. Below that, we can see those product categories again, and just the total price, instead of broken out by region. You can scroll down, there are lots more options. If I go down further, we're looking at the product categories and then the product names below that. This time it's the quantity, rather than the price. I'll select that one. I'll click OK, and it puts a new sheet in the workbook. Here's the layout that I selected. Now it's got the quantity. I'm also going to add the total price. Over here, I can see all the fields from that data sheet. I'll click on total price. That puts another column here where the values are. This one went in as Sum of Total Price. This one is Count of Quantity. If I go back and look at my data, I can see that going down the quantity column, there's one item here that's text rather than a number. So Excel sees this not as a number column, but as either text or mixed numbers and text. So it defaults to Count. But we can change that. I'll just right click on one of those numbers, Summarize Values By, and instead of Count, I'll click on Sum. So now we can see the total quantity and the total price for each product category and product. It's a quick way to get started. You can change the layout after you've selected one of the sample layouts, but you're up and running very quickly.

In this cell, we have a list of weekdays. I click on that Arrow, click a weekday, and it fills in the cell. The same thing for months. Here's a list. It only shows 8 items at a time, but I can scroll down and click December. Those lists are on another worksheet, and then use data validation, on the Data tab, to set that up. There are a few limitations though. The font is very small and you can't change it. And you can only see eight items at a time. This doesn't auto complete. Data validation doesn't help you fill in the word. Excel might help you, if it can copy something that you've already entered above, but the data validation itself won't help me type January. If I start typing, I have to fill in the whole word and move on to the next cell. So data validation is helpful, but I've come up with a work around that you can download on my website and it uses a combo box over cells that have a data validation drop down. In this corner, hidden away, is a little combo box, and it pops up over a cell, when you double click on it. So if I double click here, the Combo box comes out of hiding, goes over this cell, and picks up the same data validation list that the cell uses. So when I click the arrow, I'll see the list of weekdays. I can click on one, press Enter to go to the next cell. I'll double click again, and for this one I could start typing T, and it fills in Tuesday, but if I wanted Thursday, I'll type in h, and then press Enter. So it helps with the typing, and if we look at the months, I've changed the number of rows that show, so we can see 12. You can adjust that setting, as well as the font size, and select. And again here, we can type. So if I want to type August, just have to type two letters and it's filled in for me. To see the Combo box, I'm going to double click on a cell and then go to the Developer tab on the ribbon, and there's a Design Mode button. When I click that, I'm able to make changes to that Combo box. I can click on the Properties button and here are all the things you could change about that Combo box. So you get a lot more control over it than you have over data validation. So you could come down here, and go to the font. Instead of Arial font, you could change the font, and the font size, to whatever suits you. And here's where I changed the list rows. This is 12 you could make that a larger number. You'd want to pick a number that's going to fit on the screen. You don't want anything that's too huge, but you can adjust that setting. And then when you're done making changes, turn off Design Mode, and you're ready to go again. So if you download the sample file from my website, you'll be able to copy it all into your workbook. Copy the Combo box and the code onto the worksheet. So if I right click View Code, you'll see that there's code that runs, when you double click the cell. You don't have to understand all this code, you would just have to get it into your workbook.

In this example, we're going to enter the annual rate, and then the number of payments we have to make, the amount that we'll be borrowing, and then we'll use the PMT function in this cell to calculate the monthly payment. The annual rate that we're going to pay is 5%. In this cell, we're going to borrow the amount over four years. There are 12 months per year, so 48 months. I'll be making 48 payments, and the amount that we're going to borrow is $10,000. Those are the three numbers that we need in order to calculate the monthly payment. Here is the syntax for the PMT function. We'll start by typing equals, and then PMT, open bracket, and now I'm going to click on the cell where I entered the rate. I'll click here where it says 5%, but it's not 5% per month. That's the annual rate. I'm going to click after that cell reference, type a slash for division. then I'll type 12, because we're paying that rate over 12 months. Then I'll type a comma, and the next argument is the number of periods. I'll click on the Number of Payments cell, and type another comma. The present value, or the amount of the loan, is 10,000, so I'll click on that cell. The other two arguments are optional, so I'm not going to use them. The fv is the future value, so that's what you want left at the end of all your payments, and if you don't enter it, we assume zero. We want to pay everything off, so I don't have to enter anything there. The type is also optional. If I omit it, we assume that it's zero, and you're going to be making your payments at the end of the period. If you type a one, then you'd be paying at the beginning of the period. I'll close the bracket and press Enter, and there's the monthly payment. It's in this cell as a negative amount because it's a payment that I owe, but if you wanted to show it as a positive number, just click after the equals sign, right before the PMT function name, and type a minus sign, and press Enter. Now that shows as a positive amount in the payment cell.

The first step is to do calculations to get some key numbers. So we want to get the minimum, maximum, quartile one, and three, and the median. These just use simple Excel functions. So for the minimum, it's the MIN function, using the data in the east region. For quartile one, it's the QUARTILE function, with one as the second argument. And then the MEDIAN function, QUARTILE, three, and MAX. Once you have those done, you can copy them across for the west region. Those numbers will let us create boxes. We're going to create a stacked column chart. It will have three boxes in it. The bottom one will be hidden, and then a box going from quartile one to the median, median to quartile three, and we'll have error bars, one going up to the maximum, and one coming down to the minimum. To figure out the size of these boxes, we're going to do calculations in these cells. The first thing we're going to do is figure out the height of this hidden box. It goes from the bottom up to the Q1 measurement, so we just have to link to that Q1 measurement cell. Equals Q1, and that tells us how high that hidden box is. The lower box here goes from Q1 to the median. So in this cell, I'll type equals, median, minus, Q1. For the upper box, it's going to be Q3 minus the median will give us the height here, so equals Q3, minus median, and that will be six. I'll copy those across for the west region. The final step is to calculate the length of the whiskers, so the top one is the max minus Q3. Equals max minus Q3. And the bottom one is Q1 minus min. Equals Q1 minus min. And then copy those across. So we have all the measurements now, and the first step in creating the chart will be to create the stacked column chart. I'm going to select the heading, starting with the blank cell, and across the other two columns. Press the control key and select all the cells with the labels and values for the boxes. On the Insert tab, click the Column Chart, and the Stacked Column. If you get the wrong layout, here it's using east and west as series. I want that switched, so I'll click Switch Row/Column, and now I have east and west stacked. I'm going to click on that legend and delete it. Now I'll move this chart off to the side a bit, and make it narrower, so that I can see the data in behind. To add the whisker at the top, I'm going to select the top box, and on the Design tab of the ribbon, click Add Chart Element, Error Bars, More Error Bar Options. I want a plus. I want this to go up from the top. And scrolling down, I want a custom error amount. Click Specify Value. I'm going to change the positive error value. So I'll delete what's in there, and select the two values for the top whisker. Click Okay. And next, I'll add error bars to the bottom. This box that's going to be hidden. So I select that, click Add Chart Element, Error Bars, More Error Bar Options, and this one will be minus. We want it coming down from the top of this base box. For the error amount, custom, specify value. This time, we're going to delete what's in there as a negative value. And select the two values that we have for whisker bottom, click Okay, and it's now coming down from the top of that base box. This one, we're going to hide, so I'm going to select it, and on the Format tab, for the Fill, I'll put No Fill. And as a final step, I will format the other two boxes, so that they're the same color, with a slightly darker border. So I'll select this one and I'll make it a light gray, and slightly darker border. The same thing for the bottom box. And I'll click the same fill color and border color. So we now have a box plot with whiskers that show the maximum and the minimum. #ContexturesExcelTips",28,Science & Technology,PT5M21S,321,2d,hd,TRUE,,1,524243,1276,78,0,118

You can also create your own fields by using a calculated field. We'll add a calculated field in this pivot table, that shows the bonus that each salesperson will earn, based on their total sales.

In here I'll click Calculations, Fields, Items & Sets, and here click Calculated Field. The first thing we'll do is give this a name, and this is going to be the calculated bonus for each sales rep. I'll call it ""RepBonus"" and press tab to get down to the next box. This is where we're going to put in the formula. In the pivot table, there's a field called Total, and we can see it in this list of fields here. I want to use that. I'll double click on it here and it puts that name into the formula. I want to take that total, and the bonus is going to be 3% of that total. I'll type a space. You don't need a space, but I like to add one just so it's easier to read the formula. Then a multiplier. I'll put it in an asterisk, another space, and this time I'm going to type in a value. It's nothing from my field list that I can use. I'll type 3% and click Add, and that's adding it to this list. It's also going to add it to the pivot table, when I click OK. There's the new field, Sum of RepBonus, and we can see that it's 3% for each of these totals. We can change the heading, so I'll type Bonus, instead of this long title, and then make the column narrower. So that's a simple calculated field.

The SUMIFS function will show a total based on one or more criteria. Watch this short video to see the steps, and then verify that the total is correct.

So here we have a column where we've sold items on certain dates and we can see how many units we sold each day. We have a total at the bottom, and that just uses the SUM function. If you want to put some conditions on the total, instead of using SUM, you could use a SUMIFS function. This is available in Excel 2007 and later versions. In this cell I'd like to see the total for a specific date range. I've put a starting date here and an ending date. In this cell I'm going to put in a SUMIFS formula, and it will look at the dates and then only total the units that are between the start and end date. To start the formula, I'll click in this cell, type an equal sign and the SUMIFS function, and open bracket. The first thing we have to put in is the sum range, so which cells do we want to add up if we meet the criteria? We want to add these units sold. Put that in, and put in a comma. The next thing is the criteria range. Which cells do we want to check to see if they meet the criteria that we've set. And that's the date cells. I'll select those. Type a comma. The next thing is the first criteria. We want it to be based on this start date. We want any numbers that are for a date on or after this start date. I'm going to put the operator in, and the operator will be greater than or equal to, and I have to put that inside quotes. Double quote, greater than, equal to, double quote. I'm going to join that to a cell reference. I'll put in an ampersand and then click on the start cell, so it's going to look for any items where the date is on or after that start date. Then we're going to have to put in our end date. For the criteria range 2, again, we want it to check those dates, type a comma. The second criteria is this end date. We want things that are on or before that. Again, the operator will go in double quotes, and this will be less than, equal to, double quote, and we'll join with the ampersand. Click on the end date, and close the bracket. Press Enter. We can see that there were 494 units sold in this date range. To verify that quickly, we can manually select the dates in that date range. The first one within that date range is January 9th going down to February 4th. When I look in the status bar, the sum is 494, which matches our total. So with SUMIFS you can use multiple criteria to get a total.

I'd like a drop down list in this cell so it's easy to select a name. On another sheet in the file, I've created a list of names with the title Employees at the top. The first step will be to create a Named Table, and to do that, I'll go to the ribbon, and click the Insert tab, then click Table. Here's the Create Table window, and it's already selected the range where my list is. I'm going to say yes there are headers because this cell is a header, so check that box and click OK. We now have a table and if I click somewhere in that table, I can see its name up here in the Table Name box. I'm going to use these employee names in my drop down list. The next step will be to give an Excel name to the range of cells where the employee names are. I'm going up to the ribbon, and on the Formula tab and in this Defined Names group, I'll click Define Name. I'm going to call this EmpList, the short version of Employee List. The scope will be the workbook, I want to be able to use this name anywhere in the workbook. I won't add a comment, and right now it's just showing the cell I have selected on the worksheet. I'm going to delete that. For the Refers To, I want it to refer to this table. I'm going to click an =, and click this button to go to the worksheet. If I move my pointer just to the top of the column, and click there, it picks up that table and shows the name of the column. This is Table 1 and the Employees column. Click the button to go back into the Dialog box. This name is going to be equal to whatever is in that column and as the column grows or shrinks, it's going to keep track of it for us. Click OK and we now have a name in our workbook that we can use in a drop down list. I'm going back to the other sheet. These are the cells where we want the drop down list. I'll select all of those cells, and on the ribbon, go to the Data tab, and click Data Validation. Instead of just any value, we want to allow a list. In this source box, I'm going to type an =. On your keyboard, press the F3 key, and that opens up a list with names. There's the name I created. I'll select that and click OK, and it puts it in for us. When I click OK now, I've got data validation. So each cell that I click on, you'll see the drop down arrow. I can select anyone of the names, go down, and assign an employee to each week without trying to remember all the names. It creates that list so the data entry is easy for us.

The button will open the Help form to a specific page, and show the relevant Help information. Download the sample file from my Contextures website: https://www.contextures.com/exceluserformmultipagehelp.html =============== Video Transcript - Abridged ----- If you create an Excel file for other people to use, you might want to leave some instructions for them. In this workbook, we have 3 sheets. Instead of putting notes on the sheets, put notes in a UserForm and add a Help button on each sheet to open that Help file if they'd like some assistance. First, go to the Developer tab, click Visual Basic. That opens the Visual Basic Editor. Hhere we can see any workbooks that are open. And here's the one where I want to add the User Form for Help. Make sure that file is selected and click Insert menu and UserForm. That gives us a blank User Form, named UserForm1. We'll call that Help Form. And caption it Help. Now, Help shows in that title bar. We'd like this UserForm to show specific instructions for sheet the user has clicked the Help button on. Click title bar and in the toolbox this control is the multi page. Click it and draw a rectangle that almost fills this UserForm. I'd like a Help tab for each worksheet. I've got page 1, 2, and right click here, to add a new page. So now there are 3 pages. When I click this one, it's just called Page1. I'm going to call that Order, so I'll call it pgOrders and make the caption Orders. That will be the Help for that sheet. This one right now it's Page2. It will be pgPivot and the caption will be Pivot. And for the third one, it's pgList and the caption will be List. I'll have an S on that as well. Going back to the workbook, here's the orders sheet. I'm just going to select all that and press Ctrl C to copy. Then go back to Visual Basic and on this Orders tab, we're going to put in a label. So click Label. Just draw another rectangle to fill that space. I'll click within it, highlight that existing text, Control V to paste. Then I'm going to do the same thing for the pivot. Just go here, highlight that and copy it. Put it in another label and paste and the same for the list. Go to the prices where the list of prices is, copy that and in here, add a final label and paste. So now each tab is set up with specific Help for that worksheet. When we click on Orders, it used to say Page1 but if we look in the properties, we can see its index is zero, so the numbering starts at zero. So this will be page zero, one, and two. So we want to get to the right page when this Help UserForm opens. So to do that, we're going to create three macros that will open the right page. To store the macros, I'm going to insert a module. Now on top of the module, I'll create a public variable called iPage and this will be as an integer. That's just going to store those page numbers and a little sub Help0 and this will set the iPage equals zero. Our UserForm, we can see here, is HelpForm, HelpForm show. When we use that macro, it's going to open the first page. I'll just Ctrl C to copy that and Ctrl V to paste it twice. This will be 1 to show page one, 2, to show page two. Now going back to the UserForm, we're going to right click on it and click View Code, creates this UserForm click event, which I don't want to use. So I'm going to select initialize instead and I can delete this click event. So within here when this form is initialized, I want it to Me, which is the UserForm. Multipage is the name of that multipage control. Just press the Tab key to select that, then dot value equals, we want it to use that iPage value, so when it opens, it's going to go to whatever page our macro told that the iPage value is. Now back into the workbook, we'll go to the orders sheet and on the Developer tab, we're going to insert a button and just at the top of the sheet, this one will use Help0. Click OK. Instead of it saying Button 1, we'll put Help. When I click it now, it opens the Help at the first page, which is page zero. I'm going to copy that. Go back to the next sheet and Ctrl V to paste it, right click and click Assign Macro and this will be Help1 and click OK. On the Prices. We'll paste again, right click, assign macro, and this is Help2, OK, and then just click away from the button on each sheet so it's not selected. Now if I click Help here, we're on the first tab. On the pivot sales, if I click Help, it goes to the second tab and from prices, click Help and it goes to the third. So it opens the Help at the applicable Help screen, but you can go back and look at the others. So if someone wants to look at all the help while they're in here, they can, but it takes them immediately to the most important help for the page that they're on. To close it, just click X and you're back in the workbook.",28,Science & Technology,PT6M25S,385,2d,sd,TRUE,,1,11900,24,0,0,5

For example, sum the orders where an account is Active, and the quantity is greater than or equal to 10. This video shows the steps for using the SUMIFS function, and using cell references instead of hard coded values.

Here we would like to find a total where the status is Active, and the number of visits is greater than 10. This only works in Excel 2007 and later versions. In this cell we're going to create a formula, starting with an equal sign, and then SUMIFS, open bracket. Then the first thing we want to do is indicate which cells will be summed once we set the criteria. The amounts are what I want to sum in C2 to C6 Then a comma, and we'll do our first criteria range. So where should it check for the first criteria? That's going to be the status. I'll select those cells, type a comma, and I'm going to type in the status that I'm looking for. So inside a double quote, I'll type Active and end with another double quote and then a comma. The second criteria range is the number of visits. I'll select that, and then a comma. This time I'm going to use operators, as well as the number 10. Within quotes, greater than, equal to, and another quote. We're going to find visits where it's greater than or equal to, and an ampersand, and the number 10 Then close the bracket, and press Enter. We can see there were a total of $325 for Active accounts with 10 or more visits. Instead of typing our values into this formula, we could use a cell reference. Up here, I have a cell that says Active, and one that has our minimum value that we want to check for. I'm going to select the double quotes and the word Active and just click on the cell that has that criterion. The same thing where I have the 10 here. I'm going to click on the cell where I've typed a 10. When I press Enter, we get the same number as our results, but now it's more flexible. I can type 5 here instead of 10, and we might see a different result here. I can see there's one there a 4, so if I type a 4, my value changes to include that $100 amount.",28,Science & Technology,PT2M26S,146,2d,sd,TRUE,,1,373766,568,44,0,62

This video shows you the steps. For example, count orders where a pen is the item ordered, and the quantity is greater than or equal to 10. Put the criteria in cells, where it's easy to change them later. Get the free sample file from my Contextures site, and follow along with the video. http://www.contextures.com/xlfunctions04.html TRANSCRIPT for Excel Count With Multiple Criteria - COUNTIFS Function In Excel you can count using criteria with the COUNTIF function. In later versions of Excel (2007 and later) you can count multiple criteria with the COUNTIFS function. So here we have a list of items that we've sold and the quantity for each. We would like to find the number of orders where a pen was the item sold and the quantity is greater than 10. So in this cell I'm going to start with an equal sign and then type COUNTIFS an open bracket and the first thing I'm going to check is the item that was sold. The range, first range is A2:A10. Then I'll type a comma and the criteria for that range I'm just going to type in here inside double quotes pen, and then another comma. That's the first thing we're going to check, is what item was sold. Next will be the quantity so I'll select the range that has the quantities, another comma and we want quantity greater than or equal to 10 so within double quotes I'll do a greater than symbol, equal, and a 10, then another double quote Close the bracket and press Enter. There were two orders for pen where the quantity is greater than 10. Instead of typing these criteria in here I can refer to a cell. So instead of typing pen inside double quotes, I could click on a cell where I have typed the word pen. The same for this criteria for the quantity I'm going to take out the 10 just by deleting that, leaving the operators within the double quotes. Then I'll type an ampersand and the cell that has the number. So this is greater than or equal to whatever number is in cell E3. When I press ENTER I get the same result. It's just easier to change. Then I could type a 5 here now, and we see that there were 4 orders where the quantity is greater than or equal to 5 instead of the 10 that we had in there before. So this formula is much more flexible if you use cell references, rather than typing the values in as hard-coded values.",28,Science & Technology,PT2M23S,143,2d,sd,TRUE,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6V75h4htM_o/maxresdefault.jpg,1,462822,691,68,0,66

Then, insert a stacked bar chart, and format the bar chart so it becomes a Gantt chart, showing the project timeline. This video shows how to calculate the start date for each task, and create and format the Gantt chart to show the timeline. '----------------------- Transcript: In this workbook I have a list of tasks for preparing our company budget I've put the start date for our first task and estimated how many days each of these steps will take us. On another sheet I have a list of the holidays and I've selected those cells and named that range HolidayList. So, going back to our task list from this start date I'll be able to calculate all the start dates for the following tasks and then once those are all filled in we'll create a chart that shows the timeline. So to figure out when this next task can start, I'm going to use the WORKDAY function. So type an equal sign and then WORKDAY and it's going to give us a date based on the starting date and then the workday that is ten days after that. I'm pressing Tab to enter that function name then the start date is the date of the previous task, then a comma to do the next argument and the number of days is 10. So this one will be ten days after that previous task. Then a comma and our holidays -- if you have a holiday list you can use it -- or you can just leave this argument out if you don't have any holidays. So I'm going to this list and it automatically puts in the name of that list. I'll close that formula and there's the date that the next task will start. Then I can fill that down to the last cell so we know that our last task will be starting on July 19th. And now to create chart from this I'm going to select. I've left the heading of the task list blank. I'm going to select from that blank cell down to the last row of data and over to column C, to include the number of days. So with those cells selected, I'll go to the Insert tab on the Ribbon. and I want to use a bar chart and the type will be the stacked bar. So that creates a list of our tasks, and the red portion is the task activity. So we'll clean this chart up a bit so it looks better. First of all, we can see that our task list here has been reversed in the chart. We also want to get rid of these blue bars which are really just placeholders to show when the tasks start. To do that, we're going to click on one of these blue bars and then on the Ribbon we now have a Chart Tools heading and under that I'll go to Format. and for the shape fill I'll click No Fill. So those bars disappear. We also can get rid of this logo because we're only going to have one item showing in the chart, which is the the days that that task runs. To get rid of the legend, I'll go to the Layout tab and under Legend click None. Now to get this list back in the order that it is on the worksheet I'll click on those labels. I'm on the Layout tab still, I'll go to format selection Axis options. I want these categories in reverse order. If we look at the chart they're now matching what's on the worksheet, but it's also put the dates at the top of the chart. To change that I'm going down to Horizontal axis crosses and put those at Maximum Category then click OK. So now we can see that the chart has the tasks in the order that we want them and the dates are back at the bottom. We also have a lot of gap here between the axis and where the first tasks starts. So instead of letting Excel decide what the first date should be here, we've got about 20 days of empty space so we'll just get rid of those. To do that I'll click on this axis at the bottom. And Format Selection so instead of letting the minimum be automatic we'll make it fixed. And we wanted to add 20 days to where it starts so there, there's just a small gap now, between the axis and the first task. And to make these bars wider, so there is not as much gap between them, I'll select one of these bars, Format Selection and I'll put No Gap, or you could leave a very small gap between them. And so there is our task list and a timeline using a Gantt chart, created with the bar chart in Excel",28,Science & Technology,PT5M11S,311,2d,sd,TRUE,,1,155946,191,13,0,25

If you don't need to keep links to the original data, use the Paste Special Transpose command instead. You can use the TRANSPOSE function to do the following: --Change data orientation from horizontal to vertical --Use it with other functions to total a range of cells Watch this video to see how to use the Excel TRANSPOSE function, and combine it with other functions.

So if something changes here, it would also change in the display data with the TRANSPOSE function. To look at an example of how we can use it, we have four years of data and the units sold in each year. To transpose that, I would like to have the years down a column and the unit sales beside each year. I've got 4 columns by 2 rows. To transpose that, I'll select the opposite. I want 4 rows and 2 columns. With those cells selected, I type =TRANSPOSE, open bracket, and then the cells from the original data. Close the bracket and the TRANSPOSE function is array entered. So on the keyboard, press the Ctrl and shift keys, and then tap the Enter key. And if you look in the Formula Bar, you can see curly brackets have been added at the beginning and end of that formula to show that it's array entered. So there's the data that's gone from horizontal to vertical. You can do that with other functions though. The TRANSPOSE function is a bit limiting because you have to know, ahead of time, exactly the size of the original data and the size, select that size in the location where you're pasting it. If you use a function like INDEX instead. So here I've used INDEX, and I could just make that more flexible. I'm not sure how many years of data I'm going to have. Each formula's individually entered in a cell. It's not array entered, so it gives me a bit more flexibility. So that's an alternative to using TRANSPOSE is to, to use another function like INDEX. If you don't need to keep the links, you can also use Paste Special to change data from horizontal to vertical. If I selected these three cells, and on the Home tab, I'll copy them. Then I can select a cell where I'd like to start pasting those. I don't have to pick the range that's the exact size. I just select the starting cell and then from the Paste drop down, click Transpose and there's the transposed data, and the original is still there. They're not linked at all, but you have the data in a different layout. You can use TRANSPOSE in other formulas. This is a very long, complicated formula, but you can see TRANSPOSE is used in here. You can see curly brackets at the end and the beginning. So this is another array-entered formula, and it's looking at all these years of salaries and finding the best four consecutive years.",28,Science & Technology,PT3M22S,202,2d,sd,TRUE,,1,412855,541,89,0,64

In this case, we would like to highlight each row in this list if the number of units sold is greater than 75. So to do that, I'm going to select all of the rows, all of the columns in each row. So I've selected from A2 down to D10. On the Ribbon, on the Home tab, I'll click Conditional Formatting, and none of these preset rules will do exactly what I want. So I'm going down to New Rule, and in here I'll select a formula. So I'm going to use a formula to determine how to color each row. When I click that, there's a spot where I can put the formula. I want to, in each row, look at the value that's in column B. So I'll type = And we want, from every column, we want to look at column B. So we have to lock that cell. We don't want it to be relative, we want it to be absolute. So type a $ to lock that in. And then B. And we want, in this case, the active cell we can see is white, where the other cells are highlighted with blue. We can see that, in the name box, A2 is showing up. So that's the active cell, so the active row is 2. So I'm going to type 2 here. We're going to check what's in B2 and see if it's greater than 75. So that's our test. And if it is greater than 75, we want to format it. So I'll click Format and I'll choose a fill color, maybe a blue color and click OK, and click OK again. And now, any row where the number of units is greater than 75, all four cells in that row are colored blue.",28,Science & Technology,PT2M39S,159,2d,sd,TRUE,,1,382466,431,31,0,62

I would like to get the date and the customer for each of the high priced orders. Back on the Orders sheet, I've started a criteria area here.

'---------------------- Transcript for Excel Drop Downs From List on Different Sheet In this workbook, there's a sheet where people will enter order information. They'll put in a date, and then a product, and the quantity sold. To make it easier for people, in the Product column, instead of them typing a product name, which could result in errors or invalid products, we're going to create a drop-down list so they just have to select a product instead of typing it. On a different worksheet, on the Products sheet here, there's a list of products and we'll use that to create the drop-down list. Because this is on a different worksheet, we're going to have to name this list first before we can use it for the drop downs. I'm going to select all the cells that have product names, and then click in the name box, and I'm going to type a one-word name for this. I'm going to call this ProductList and then I'll press the Enter key to finish naming that range. And you can see the name up here now. If I select a different cell, and select ProductList, it goes to that list right away. So this is a name in the workbook now and I can go back to the Orders sheet and I'll select all the cells where I'd like that drop-down to appear. Then on the Data tab of the ribbon, in the Data Tools section, I'll click, at the top of this Data Validation command, and that opens this window. Under Settings, for Allow, I would like a list. As the Source of this list, I could type an equal sign and the name of the list, but an easier way is on your keyboard, press the F3 key, and that opens up a Paste Name window. I'll click on the list I want to use. Click OK and you can see it now, just as if we had typed it. Click OK and now each of these cells has a drop-down list. The arrow only appears when you click on the cell. You can only have one drop-down visible at any time. You can't make these appear all the time but you can then click that arrow and select one of the products and it'll automatically then appear in the cell.",28,Science & Technology,PT2M45S,165,2d,sd,TRUE,,1,241743,506,24,0,73

In this row, it's B2. I'll type a comma. And then the reference, so what am I comparing it to? I want to compare it to all the other scores. I'll start at B2 and drag down to B11. Now I'm going to be copying this formula down to all the other rows. As I copy it down, I want it to always change the cell that it's checking, but I don't want it to change the cells that it's comparing to. It should always be B2 to B11. While I'm at the end of this reference that I just typed, on the keyboard I'm going to press the F4 key, and that makes this an absolute reference so this won't change as I copy the formula down. And I'll finish with a ) and press Enter. The score 46 is ranked 1, and I'll click on this cell, and drag the fill handle down. We can see all the other ranks.

To make this easy, I've got both the workbooks open and I'm going to show them side by side. On the Ribbon, on the View tab, I'll click Arrange All, and I'd like to see them vertically arranged. I'll click OK, and now I can see the price list and beside that is the list of orders. For the VLOOKUP, I will start with an equal sign and type VLOOKUP and an open bracket. Then I click on the cell that has the value I want to look for in the price list. I want to find the price of paper, so I'll click on that, and then type a comma, to start the next argument. The next argument is where is the lookup table? This is in the other workbook, so I'll click on that and select the cells where the price list is. You can see that in the other workbook now, and I'll press the comma to start the next argument. And to finish, I want to say which column the prices are in. We can see that they're in 1, 2. So the prices are in column 2. I'll type 2 and then I want an exact match always. I don't want just some random price that seems close. So I'll click False, close the bracket and press Enter. Now, in the formula bar, you can see there's the name of the other workbook and the sheet and the cells where the price list is. I'll just copy that down to the rest of the orders and everything's working nicely. If I go back and close the price list, save the changes. Now this workbook, we can see the VLOOKUP shows the full path to that other workbook, but everything still works well. The VLOOKUP works, even though the workbook with the price list is closed now. So you can use VLOOKUP to refer to a list in another workbook, and it's easiest if you make the link with both workbooks open.",28,Science & Technology,PT3M24S,204,2d,sd,TRUE,,1,389868,648,65,0,52

Instead of doing the steps manually, you can use a macro. In this video you'll see the steps for manually formatting a pivot table, compared to the speed of running the Classic Pivot Table Formatting macro from Bob Ryan, of http://SimplyLearningExcel.com You'll see the manual steps required to format the pivot table in Classic Style: -change the subtotal setting -change the report layout -change the pivot table style -change the pivot table display options -change the setting to prevent old items in the drop downs -format each value field as number format -sort each row field alphabetically. Then, see how much quicker it is to run the recorded macro, to format the pivot table in seconds, instead of minutes. If you record your own macro while make the changes to the pivot table, you will need to edit that macro, so it works on any pivot table, no matter what the field names are, or where the pivot table is located.

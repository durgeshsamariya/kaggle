And what information do you use to make that decision? Selecting a model based on the best performance on a loss metric can work really well in some cases, but if you want to move from competitions to deploying models professionally, there are other factors you’ll need to consider. From December 3-5, 2019, we’re running a practical model evaluation workshop focused on answering these questions and more. During the workshop I’ll walk you through: Deciding what factors are most important for your project Training models to evaluate using different autoML systems Selecting the best model based on which factors are most important to you You’ll get daily emails with links to notebooks and exercises as well as daily live streams where you can ask questions and get feedback.

A Crash Course for Non-Engineers | CareerCon 2019 | Kaggle	The job of non-technical business analysts is changing: there is more and more data that is being used to make critical, quantitative decisions. It's becoming common for people to do a bit of computational, analytical work as part of their job, whatever that happens to be - human resources, recruiting, product management or sales. Some of those people do become enthusiasts and transition to full fledged Data Scientist roles. In this talk we will discuss what that transition entails and look at how to achieve that goal.

When Jeff Dean was finishing grad school, he was seriously considering committing to the world of academia. It isn't widely known that despite his aspirations, Jeff only received one academic interview and offer, and not from a top- or even mid-tier school, so he went into industrial research. What IS widely known is his massive contributions to Google's engineering developments.

About the presenter: After a PhD in physics and postdoctoral work in medical imaging, Dr. Kiri Nichol got into machine learning by tackling problems on Kaggle, attaining master status on her 8th competition. Kiri has worked as a data scientist and machine learning engineer/researcher. Her current research interests involve using unsupervised methods to reduce the amount of labeled data needed for deep learning. In 2013 Kiri was a finalist in setup.nl’s competition to create an algorithm to fake a Mondrian painting and a film clip about Kiri’s algorithm has been exhibited in the Gemeentemuseum in the Hague. Kaggle Days San Francisco held in April 2019 gathered over 300 participants to meet, learn and code with Kaggle Grandmasters, and compete in our traditional offline competition.

About Konstantin: "I am Konstantin Lopukhin and I enjoy applying machine learning to all kinds of problems, and I really like it if the solution turns out elegant and has high quality. I work at Scrapinghub, we turn the internet into a dataset to help other people achieve their goals. I'm working on an exciting project where we extract information from any web page using computer vision and deep learning, replacing manual spider development with machine learning. I also like doing Kaggle competitions, especially if the problem is unusual and it's hard to tell which approach is going to be the best one. Recently I took the 1st place in Kaggle Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge with Pawel Jankiewicz, was 2nd in Kaggle Sea Lion Population Count, and had a few other gold medals."

The main objective was to use feature engineering as possible (even if you fail at times), including using deep learning to generate new features and to avoid ensembling too early in the competition.

This edition is presented by LogicAI with sponsorship from Kaggle and Google Cloud. Kaggle Days are a global series of offline events for seasoned data scientists and Kagglers created by LogicAI and Kaggle. About the presenter: Bojan was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina, which his family fled for Croatia during the war. He came to the US as a high school exchange student, and manage to realize his dream of studying Physics. He hold a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Illinois, and a M.S. in Applied Physics and B.S. in Physics from Stanford University. He’s worked in academia for a few years, but for various personal and professional reasons decided to leave it. A few years ago he stumbled upon the wonderful world of Data Science and Machine Learning, and feel like he has discovered his second vocation in life. He has been on Kaggle for three and a half years, and he believes it’s the best platform that he’s ever come across for learning new skills. It has been an invaluable tool in his ongoing development as a data scientist. He is a a Data Scientist at H2O.ai, where he works on various internal and external projects. Highlights of the projects and problems that he has worked on include used cars sales price predictions, insurance claims predictions, credit underwriting models, and restaurant classification based on user-generated images. He is particularly passionate and interested in NLP problems. Bojan has a wonderful wife and three amazing little boys that keep him constantly busy and amused. He is a voracious reader, is passionate about tinkering with all sorts of tools and gadgets, loves digital photography, and really enjoys hiking in the woods.

We calculate Chi-square between each feature & the target & select the desired number of features with best Chi-square scores or the lowest p-values. The Chi-squared (χ2) test is used in statistics to test the independence of two events. More specifically in feature selection we use it to test whether the occurrence of a specific feature & the target are independent or not. For each feature & target combination, a corresponding high χ2 chi-square score or a low p-value indicates that the target column is dependent on the feature column.

It checks if your time series is stationary or not. A stationary time series is one whose statistical properties such as mean, variance, autocorrelation, are all constant over time. Such statistics are useful as descriptors of future behavior only if the series is stationary. The hypotheses for the test: The null hypothesis for this test is that the time series is non-stationary. The alternate hypothesis for this test is that the time series is stationary. In this video we aim to implement the ADF test from scratch.

The assumption for the test is that both groups are sampled from normal distributions with equal variances. The null hypothesis is that the two means are equal, and the alternative is that they are not. This tutorial covers the basics of performing t-tests in Python.

In this video, I'll bring out the differences of all 3 using Python. Batch is great for convex, or relatively smooth error manifolds. In this case, we move somewhat directly towards an optimum solution, either local or global. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) computes the gradient using a single sample. Here, the term "stochastic" comes from the fact that the gradient based on a single training sample is a "stochastic approximation" of the "true" cost gradient. Due to its stochastic nature, the path towards the global cost minimum is not "direct" as in GD, but may go "zig-zag" if we are visualizing the cost surface in a 2D space. However, it has been shown that SGD almost surely converges to the global cost minimum if the cost function is convex. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent combines the best of both to converge faster with less computational overhead. In this video, I'll walk you through all 3 variants of Gradient Descent so that the concept is clear.

It is used on univariate data which follows an approximately normal distribution, and can be used to detect one or more outliers. It is especially useful in situations where the number of outliers is not known: in other outlier tests, like the Grubbs test and the Tietjen Moore test, the number of outliers to be found must be specified beforehand. For the ESD test, you just specify an upper bound for the number of outliers. We test the null hypothesis that the data has no outliers vs. the alternative hypothesis that there are at most k outliers (for some user specified value of k).

Numpy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. A NumPy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. The Python core library provided Lists. A list is the Python equivalent of an array, but is resizeable and can contain elements of different types. How is Numpy so fast? In this video we find out how Numpy’s ndarray is stored and how it is usually manipulated by Numpy functions.

The abstract definition of grouping is to provide a mapping of labels to group names One aspect that I’ve recently been exploring is the task of grouping large data frames by different variables, and applying summary functions on each group. This is accomplished in Pandas using the “groupby()” and “agg()” functions of Panda’s DataFrame objects. In this video, I will try to present a simple example which demonstrates the power of GroupBy function of Pandas!

The original time series is often split into 3 component series: Seasonal: Patterns that repeat with a fixed period of time. For example, a website might receive more visits during weekends; this would produce data with a seasonality of 7 days. Trend: The underlying trend of the metrics. A website increasing in popularity should show a general trend that goes up. Random: Also call "noise", "irregular" or "remainder", this is the residuals of the original time series after the seasonal & trend series are removed. In this video, you will discover time series decomposition from scratch.

Random search is a technique where random combinations of the hyperparameters are used to find the best solution for the built model. It is similar to grid search, and yet it has proven to yield better results comparatively. Instead of searching over the entire grid, random search only evaluates a random sample of points on the grid. This makes random search a lot cheaper than grid search. Random search wasn’t taken very seriously before. This is because it doesn’t search over all the grid points, so it cannot possibly beat the optimum found by grid search. But then along came Bergstra and Bengio. They showed that, in surprisingly many instances, random search performs about as well as grid search. All in all, trying 60 random points sampled from the grid seems to be good enough.

In Grid Search, we try every combination of a preset list of values of the hyper-parameters and evaluate the model for each combination. The pattern followed here is similar to the grid, where all the values are placed in the form of a matrix. Each set of parameters is taken into consideration and the accuracy is noted. Once all the combinations are evaluated, the model with the set of parameters which give the top accuracy is considered to be the best. In Random Search, we try random combinations of the hyperparameters which are used to find the best solution for the built model. It tries random combinations of a range of values. To optimise with random search, the function is evaluated at some number of random configurations in the parameter space. The chances of finding the optimal parameter are comparatively higher in random search because of the random search pattern where the model might end up being trained on the optimised parameters without any aliasing.

ExtraTrees Classifier is an ensemble method which is much faster than RandomForest yet equall accurate. Extra trees seem much faster (about three times) than the random forest method (at, least, in scikit-learn implementation). This is consistent with the theoretical construction of the two learners. On toy datasets, the following conclusions could be reached : - Extra trees seem to keep a higher performance in presence of noisy features, - When all the variables are relevant, both methods seem to achieve the same performance.

To detect colinearity among variables, simply create a correlation matrix and find variables with large absolute values. In R use the corr function and in python this can by accomplished by using numpy's corrcoef function. Multicolinearity on the other hand is more troublesome to detect because it emerges when three or more variables, which are highly correlated, are included within a model. To make matters worst multicolinearity can emerge even when isolated pairs of variables are not colinear. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is a measure of colinearity among predictor variables within a multiple regression. It is calculated by taking the the ratio of the variance of all a given model's betas divide by the variane of a single beta if it were fit alone.

The individual classification models are trained based on the complete training set; then, the meta-classifier is fitted based on the outputs -- meta-features -- of the individual classification models in the ensemble. The meta-classifier can either be trained on the predicted class labels or probabilities from the ensemble. Let's first understand how a stacking classifier works and create a simple stacking classifier in Python.

This helps the training algorithm to learn the features as we have enough examples for all the different cases. For example, in learning a spam filter, we should have good amount of data which corresponds to emails which are spam and non spam.

If we have highly imbalanced classes and have no addressed it during preprocessing, we have the option of using the class_weight parameter to weight the classes to make certain we have a balanced mix of each class. Specifically, the balanced argument will automatically weigh classes inversely proportional to their frequency.

We both can start with two different belief & can reach to same conclusion by continuously updating our believes based on the available evidence. This is a small video which explains how Bayes theorem works and how is it useful in Machine Learning! Bayes' Theorem is an incredibly powerful theorem in probability that allows us to relate P(A|B) to P(B|A). This is helpful because we often have an asymmetry where one of these conditional probabilities is easy to compute and the other is not. It let's us treat compute how to update our probabilities given new information.

This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what is Machine Learning, what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, how Machine Learning works with simple examples, and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results. Machine learning is starting to reshape how we live, and it’s time we understood what it is and why it matters. Now, let us deep dive into this short video and understand the basics of Machine Learning.

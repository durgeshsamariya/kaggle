The first is making sure queries have been designed to refresh at optimal speeds. Primary topics for performance tuning include: removing columns and rows, applied step configuration and order precedence, query folding, managing variables, and tables vs lists for transformations. The other important cornerstone is intelligently identifying and handling errors as they occur during scheduled refreshes. Primary topics for error handling include: replacing vs removing errors, collecting error metadata, and configuring the refresh to either fail or refresh successfully when errors occur.

But when it comes to performance and even correct numbers, one should spend some time in finding the right way of modelling the tables and how they are related to each other. In this talk, we spend an hour doing exactly that. You will get answers to questions like: Why should you care about the data model? What kind of relations are available? How do they influence performance? Why redundancy is (not) a bad thing? Don’t just tell your friends that you're a professional who works with models, but be great in doing it.

It's included with Power BI Premium so you have the ability to move to the cloud on your terms. In this week's webinar the Report Server team will answer your questions AND show you the answers live. Don't have any questions? Not to worry we will have the team pull out their favorite demo and show why you should start using Microsoft Report Server now. About our host Chris Finlan: Since its introduction in 2013, Christopher Finlan has been one of the top evangelists for Power BI in his role at Microsoft. As the lead Business Intelligence Technology Solution resource in the Mid-Atlantic Region, he was responsible for helping over 140 enterprise customers align their specific requirements to the Microsoft Cloud and Data Platform. His unique presentation style and background in “shadow IT” has made him a highly sought-after speaker for customer presentations from the server room to the board room on a wide variety of BI-related topics. Prior to joining Microsoft, Chris led the transition for his team to a fast and flexible reporting and LOB solution that integrated Microsoft Technology with SAP Data. By creating and implementing customized mobile and desktop applications that supported hundreds of internal users across diverse lines of business, he saw first-hand how Microsoft’s tools could transform a business in record time and generate millions of dollars of savings from lost productivity and wasted investments in technology that had ten times the cost while providing a fraction of the value. He spoke about some of that experience during his appearance on the popular .Net Rocks! internet talk show. Currently a Senior Program Manager on the Power BI team, Chris has been working in the software industry in various roles, from the product team to pre-sales, technical training, database administration and sales operations. He holds a B.A. from Temple University in Philadelphia. Follow us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/mspowerbi More questions?

DAX sits on top of one of the fastest databases around, and this webinar will explore some unusual and creative scenarios that you may not have thought of as feasible. The webinar will aim to reset your understanding of what is possible in DAX by walking through some interesting code highlights from a recent series of games built using DAX (Blackjack, Sudoku , Tic Tac Toe , Hangman & Minesweeper). Each game pushes and explores different boundaries in DAX and will attempt to show just where those lines are. The session will hopefully inspire you to add some creative and exciting techniques to your own DAX based data models. Full source code will be made available for download.

In the August update Power BI was enhanced to enable the dynamic creation of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images making it now it is possible to create measures that dynamically update to account for user selections and filters. This technique is available for use with any visual that renders Image URLs as an image. This puts SVG on par with how we currently use non-vector image types such as PNG, employing them as indicator columns in the Table visual or in other creative ways. For additional information, please see his three part blog series or Gallery post on the same topic. DAVID ELDERSVELD David is a Senior Consultant and Microsoft MVP who has employed skills in technology development, data integration, data analysis, and systems analysis for over ten years.

In any organization, there is a need to analyze the text data such as customer comments, extract the primary purpose of a call from its scripts, detect the language of customer feedback and translate it and so forth. To address this issue, Microsoft Cognitive Services provides a set of APIs, SDKs, and services available to developers to do text analysis without writing R or Python codes. In this session, I will explain what is text analysis such as sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, Language detection and so forth. Next, the process of text analysis in Power BI using cognitive services will be demonstrated. Follow us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/mspowerbi More questions?

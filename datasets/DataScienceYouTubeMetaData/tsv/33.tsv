Actually, the procedure can calculate any confidence intervals you specify (e.g., 90%, 95%, 99%). The procedure is accomplished by estimating a two-way mixed model intraclass correlation coefficient, as that statistic is identical to Cronbach's alpha. Here are the two references I mention in the video: Baumgartner, T. A., & Chung, H. (2001). Confidence limits for intraclass reliability coefficients. Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise Science, 5(3), 179-188. Bravo, G., & Potvin, L. (1991).

NB: This is definitely a fully within-subjects design, as the sample size is 12 cases (all males), and all 12 cases responded to the testing across the four conditions. Gender can be a within-subjects factor, when it is a component of the stimulus, as was the case in this study. Think of it this way: whereas the data derived from the 12 males who responded to the four tests may be inferred to the population of males, the males and females who did the testing are not in any way a random sample of males/females. They are just part of the stimulus/condition. It's a bit of tricky one, but a good test to think about.	27	Education	PT5M4S	304	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qobtGqVBFig/maxresdefault.jpg	1	104795	106	11	0	21

When coupled with the observation of a significant announcement made by the company the following trading day, it may be suggested that there is evidence indicative of the possibility of insider trading. I failed to mention in the video series that I correlated the stock in question's trading volume with that of the index and found a non-significant correlation of r = -.009, which effectively means no association. Therefore, I did not feel it necessary to take into account general market trading activity into the analyses.

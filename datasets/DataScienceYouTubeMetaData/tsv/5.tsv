In order to include categorical features in your Machine Learning model, you have to encode them numerically using "dummy" or "one-hot" encoding. But how do you do this correctly using scikit-learn? In this video, you'll learn how to use OneHotEncoder and ColumnTransformer to encode your categorical features and prepare your feature matrix in a single step. You'll also learn how to include this step within a Pipeline so that you can cross-validate your model and preprocessing steps simultaneously. Finally, you'll learn why you should use scikit-learn (rather than pandas) for preprocessing your dataset.

Relevant links and the full transcript are below. Playlist: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IBLMp7LtN8Nc3Efd4hJq0kD == LINKS == Git quick reference for beginners: http://www.dataschool.io/git-quick-reference-for-beginners/ == TRANSCRIPT == In this video, we're going to talk about one of the most common problems users run into when pushing to a new GitHub repository. First, I'll show you the problem and how to resolve it. Then, I'll show you two ways to avoid running into that problem in the first place. I'll be working through the examples quickly, since all of the commands in this video are explained in previous videos. If you get lost, just watch the rest of the series and then come back to this video. Anyway, I'll start by demonstrating the problem. Let's create a repo on GitHub and initialize it with a README file. Our plan is to create a local Git repo, add a file to the local repo, and then get that repo synchronized with GitHub. Let's create a subdirectory on our local machine with the same name as the GitHub repo, though you can actually use any name you like. We then "change directory" to the subdirectory, and initialize Git with "git init". Now, we'll add a "remote" that allows you to easily reference your GitHub repo later. You type "git remote add origin" and then the URL, which will either be an HTTPS URL, or in my case, an SSH URL. I created a simple text file before the video, which I'll now copy into my local repository. Running "git status" confirms that Git has detected an untracked file. Now we'll stage that file to be committed with "git add ." and we'll commit the file with "git commit -m" and a message. Finally, we'll push the file using "git push origin master", which directs Git to push the committed changes on the master branch to the origin that we defined earlier. Unfortunately, there's an error which says that the updates were rejected because the remote contains work that we don't have locally. So why is this error occurring? It's a bit complicated, but the root of the problem is that you initialized the GitHub repo with a README file. That actually added and committed a file to your GitHub repo, which is not a file your local repo knows about. So when you try to push your text file up to GitHub, Git is confused about why your local repo doesn't have the README file in it. Git correctly guesses that you are probably trying to sync these two repos, but it would rather have you fix the problem manually than guess how to automatically fix the problem for you. So to manually fix this problem, you simply need to update your local repo with what has already occurred in your GitHub repo. To do this, we'll use the command "git pull origin master", which fetches the README file from your GitHub repo and merges it into your local repo. Now, you can once again try "git push origin master", and this time it will be successful. We can refresh the repo on GitHub, and confirm that the text file is indeed there. Now, let's talk about two ways that you could have avoided running into this problem in the first place. The first way would be to follow the exact same steps I did in this video, except don't check the box to initialize the GitHub repo with a README. That way, your GitHub repo will initially be empty, and you won't get an error the first time you try to push. The second way, which I personally prefer, is to use a cloning approach. If you've watched the rest of this video series, the cloning approach will look familiar, but I'll demonstrate it here quickly. In this approach, you first create a GitHub repo and you must initialize it with a README. Then, you clone this repo to your local machine using "git clone" followed by the repo URL. Cloning automatically downloads the GitHub repo and stores it in a subdirectory of your working directory. It also automatically sets up your origin remote, so you don't have to add the remote manually. And most importantly, your local repo and the GitHub repo are already in sync. Now, we can just copy the text file into our local repo, add it, commit it, and push. Refresh GitHub, and you'll see that the text file is there. To conclude, let me just quickly summarize this video. If you run into the problem where your push is rejected, you may just need to "git pull origin master" before you "git push origin master". If you want to avoid this problem in the first place, there are two easy ways to avoid it. One way is to follow the first part of this video but don't check the README box when creating your GitHub repo. The other way is to follow the cloning approach from the end of the video, in which you do include a README on GitHub but you use "git clone" instead of "git init" locally. Note that GitHub does not allow you to clone an empty repo, which is why you must check the box to include a README if you're going to clone.	27	Education	PT8M57S	537	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h1e8oC7g0Ps/maxresdefault.jpg	1	60692	623	22	0	204

Just read the first two chapters for now. Next is the GitHub help section. Their articles are full of diagrams as well as Git code samples. You might want to start with the Bootcamp. GitRef.org is probably the best reference guide out there. Its examples are well-written, and every entry links to the relevant section of Pro Git if you want to read more. I've also got a Git Quick Reference for Beginners on my blog, which presents all of the most common commands on a single page. Finally, these are the GitHub Guides. Each guide is a relatively quick read, and walks you through some aspect of GitHub. It also links to their Video Guides on YouTube, which might be worth checking out. These are just my favorite resources, but there are many, many other resources out there that might work better for you. Feel free to share your favorite resource in the comments.	27	Education	PT1M32S	92	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CUEXZ85l-S4/maxresdefault.jpg	1	17364	91	0	0	10

To start, let's go through what we already know about forks. Here's a diagram from my blog, and I'll link to this in the video description. In this diagram, the top level is the GitHub level, and the bottom level is your local computer. Remember that if you want to copy a GitHub repo, you just fork it, and then you can clone it to your local computer. After making changes and committing those changes, you can push the changes back up to GitHub. We won't cover pull requests in this video, but that's simply how you ask the owner of the original repo to pull your changes into their repo. Anyway, let's pretend that you forked a repo yesterday, and then today, the repo owner made some changes that you want to incorporate into your fork. Remember from a previous video that forks do not automatically stay in sync, and thus you have to do this manually. Let's look at another diagram. If you want to sync your fork with the original repo, which we call the "upstream", this actually happens through your local computer. You simply "fetch" the changes from the upstream, you "merge" them into your repo, and then you "push" them up to GitHub. Note that the "fetch" and "merge" steps are often combined into a single step called a "pull", but it's generally recommended that you fetch and merge in two separate steps. Let's actually do this for one of my repos. Here's the commit history of a repo that I forked, and here's the commit history of my fork. You can see that the original repo has one additional commit since I forked it. I've opened Git Bash, and we're already in the working directory for that repo. First, let's check our remotes with "git remote -v". We've got an "origin" remote, but we also need an "upstream" remote that points to the original repo. We'll copy the URL from GitHub. You'll probably be using the HTTPS URL, but I set up SSH so I'm using the SSH URL. Then we "git remote add upstream" and paste the URL using the "Insert" key on Windows. Let's check that it worked. Now we're ready to fetch. You type "git fetch upstream", and then type your password. That command fetched the changes, and stored them in a branch called "upstream/master". You can actually switch to that branch and look at the changes if you like, but we're going to go ahead and merge those changes. You type "git merge upstream/master", which tells git to merge that branch into your working branch, which also happens to be called "master". If you like, you can also push those changes up to GitHub, so that your GitHub repo is in sync. Just like before, we type "git push origin master", then your password, and you're done! You can see that the change is now in my repo.	27	Education	PT4M27S	267	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-zvHQXnBO6c/maxresdefault.jpg	1	83371	800	11	0	90

Specifically, we're going to edit an existing file, add a new file, commit those changes, and push those changes up to GitHub. To start, we've already opened up Git Bash and changed our working directory to test-repo. As you might recall, there's just one file in the repo, which is the "README.md" file. We're going to edit that file. Since it's a Markdown file, you can edit it in any text editor. I've opened the file in Windows Notepad, and am just going to make a simple edit and then save the file. Let's also create a new Markdown file called "new.md". We're going to use a command called "touch". It's not a Git command, but it's especially handy on Windows since it can be hard to create a file with a non-standard extension. Simply type "touch" and then the name of the file. You can see that it has been created. The file we created is empty, so let's open it in Notepad. I've written some Markdown code in this Markdown Live Editor, so that you can see a preview of what it looks like. The Markdown code is on the left, and the rendered version is on the right. I'll link to this tool in the video description. Anyway, let's copy the Markdown code to the new.md file and save it. We're back in Git Bash, and are going to run the "git status" command to see the status of our files. It tells us that we've got one tracked file that has been modified, and one untracked file that has been added. We want to stage both of these files for committing. We use the "git add" command to do this. You could do this one file at a time using "git add" and then the filename. But instead, we're going to use "git add ." which adds both of them at once. Let's run the status again. We can see that the changes are ready for committing. To commit, use the "git commit" command. We use the "-m" argument and write a message because every commit should have a descriptive message. The commit is complete, and we can run "git status" to confirm that there is nothing else to commit. We can also check the log to see that the commit is there. Everything we've done so far has only affected our local machine. To get our GitHub repo up-to-date, we need to push up our changes. To push our changes, we use the "git push" command. The specific command is "git push origin master", which means that we want to push the "master" branch to the "origin" remote. Remember that in a previous video, we set up the "origin" remote to refer to our GitHub repository. Type in your password, and you're done. Refresh GitHub, and you can see that the "README.md" file has been modified, and the "new.md" file has been added. You can also see the commit history. On my blog, dataschool.io, I've got a Git quick reference guide that I wrote specifically for beginners, containing these and other common commands. I'll link to it in the video description, and hopefully you'll find it to be useful.	27	Education	PT5M32S	332	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ruieT3Nkg2M/maxresdefault.jpg	1	283356	1735	59	0	254

The process I'll show you will work for a repo you created yourself or a repo you forked from someone else. For this demo, I'm going to use the "test-repo" that we created in the last video. Let's open up Git Bash. This shows my working directory. I'm going to change my working directory to the Desktop. Now we're ready to go. Note that all git commands start with the word "git", and then the name of the command, and then usually one or more arguments. In this case, we're going to use the "git clone" command to clone a GitHub repo. You simply type "git clone" and then the URL of the repo. How do you get that URL? I recommend that you go to the repo, scroll down here, and click the "Copy" button. Now go back to Git Bash, and at least in Windows, you can hit the "Insert" button on your keyboard to paste it. (The usual paste keyboard shortcut doesn't seem to work in Git Bash.) If all else fails, just paste the URL somewhere else and retype it. If you're following along at home, you should hit "Enter" at this point. I'm actually going to change my URL because I use SSH instead of HTTPS to communicate with GitHub. I now hit Enter, and it asks me for my password. When typing, it won't show you anything. Hit Enter when you're done, and if you typed the wrong password, just try again. The cloning operation is now complete. It has copied the repo into a subdirectory of my working directory, and that subdirectory has the same name as the repo. So, I can just "cd" into "test-repo" and "ls" to see the list of files. Notice that it now says "master". That indicates that I'm now in a folder that is being tracked by Git, and I'm currently working on the "master" branch. I don't need to run the "git init" command, because git has already been initialized in the folder. On Windows, if you're set up to show hidden files, you can also see this ".git" folder where all of the Git information is stored. Next, let's check on your "remotes". Remotes are simply references to repos that are not on your computer. To see your remotes, type "git remote -v". You'll see a remote called "origin", which links to your repo. This reference was automatically created during the cloning process. If you don't have an origin remote, you can add one by typing "git remote add origin" and then the URL of your repo. We've now cloned the repo and set up a remote. In the next video, we'll actually make some changes locally, commit them, and then push them up to GitHub.	27	Education	PT4M9S	249	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O72FWNeO-xY/maxresdefault.jpg	1	383708	1549	74	0	170

Forking is one of the simplest GitHub operations. In this case, we're going to fork the repo for the "Open Source Data Science Masters", which is basically just a Markdown document linking to good resources for learning data science topics. To fork this repo, you just need to be logged into your GitHub account, and then you click "Fork". Wait a few seconds, and it will be done. So, what actually happened here? You've simply made a copy of the repo in your own account. That copy includes all of the repository files, and even the commit history is preserved. There's also a link to the original repo that you forked, which is often called the "upstream repo". So, why did we fork this repo? Usually, you fork a repo either because you just want a copy of the files, or because you intend to contribute to that repo. We'll talk more about collaboration in a future video, but basically, here's how it works: Step 1 is that you fork the repo, which we've already done. Step 2 is that you make a modification to your fork of the repo, perhaps by adding a new link. And step 3 is that you send a "pull request" to the repo owner, asking them to pull your changes into their repo. So to be clear, once you've forked a repo, your fork does not automatically stay in sync with the original upstream repo. I'll show you in a future video how to sync your fork with the upstream. Also, you might have noticed that we did all of the forking in GitHub, not in Git. That's because forking is a GitHub concept. Nothing happened to your local machine just by virtue of forking a repo. Finally, let's say you want to delete a fork. Simply click on "Settings", scroll to the bottom, and click "Delete".	27	Education	PT2M30S	150	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f5grYMXbAV0/maxresdefault.jpg	1	87383	379	10	0	34

If you click on "Commits", you can see the commit history for the repo. A commit is a set of one or more changes made to one or more files. Each commit has a comment explaining the commit, and you can click on the comment to see the actual changes. When you go back to the main page, note that the text here is actually the comment from the most recent commit to that file or folder, and the date of that commit. It's not a description of that file or folder. Next let's click on "Issues". Issues is a system for tracking bugs or other problems with that repo. Anyone can submit an issue. Now let's go to "Pull Requests". This will make more sense once we have talked about forks, but basically, a Pull Request is when a contributor (Tony in this case) has made changes to the ggplot2 code, and they are requesting that the repo owner pull those changes into the repository. Next is "Branches". I'm not going to explain why branches are used, but I'll just say that for a simple repository, there is often only one branch, and it's called "master" by default. Next is "Contributors". These are everyone who has ever contributed to this repository. As for "Forking", we'll get to that in the next video. "Starring" is like favoriting a repo, and "Watching" is similar to starring. Finally, let's leave the repo and go to Hadley's profile page. This is his summary page, showing his most popular repos and his contributions across GitHub. If you click on repos, you can see all of his repos, the language they were written in, the commit activity in the form of a graph, and the number of stars and number of forks.	27	Education	PT2M28S	148	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QmrDht7t2gQ/maxresdefault.jpg	1	36848	92	3	0	9

Right now, we're looking at the repository for the "ggplot2" package, which is an R package that you'll be using later in the Data Science Specialization. It was created by Hadley Wickham, who is probably the most well-known creator of R packages. Anyway, here are the files being tracked. You can see that it uses a folder structure just like Mac and Windows. You can click on any folder, and see the folder contents. You can also click on any file, and see the contents of that file. If it's a code file, GitHub will render it with bold and color and italics so that it's easier to read. You can click "Raw" to see the plain text file as it was uploaded, or you can click "History" to see the history of changes to that file. Let's go back to the main screen for the repository. There is often a special file in the root directory of the repo called "README.md." It's special because that file is automatically rendered on the main page of the repo, which you can see right here. The convention on GitHub is to always include information about the repo in this file. If you click on it, you'll see the exact same rendered file. Again, you can click "Raw" to see the plain text file. The ".md" extension means that it's a Markdown file, which you will learn about later in the Specialization. You can compare the raw and rendered files to see how Markdown works. For example, using the pound (#) symbol creates a header, and using asterisks (*) creates bullets. In the next video, we'll walk through the rest of the GitHub interface.	27	Education	PT2M19S	139	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cII5ItmiYDY/maxresdefault.jpg	1	54530	129	1	0	7

To set up a GitHub account, simply go to the GitHub website and get started right here. To set up Git, go to the Help section of GitHub, click Set Up Git, select the appropriate operating system, and then follow the instructions below. A couple notes about this page: GitHub offers a native app for Mac and Windows that offers a visual interface for Git. I've never used it, and it's not going to be covered in the Data Science Specialization. You're welcome to use it if you like, but you will probably get a better understanding of Git if you start with the command line interface. Here's the link you click to actually download Git. For Windows users, here's a walkthrough of the installation process. And once you've downloaded Git, here's how to configure Git with your name and email address. Just make sure you use the same email address you used when setting up GitHub.	27	Education	PT1M15S	75	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TI3yVcSahzk/maxresdefault.jpg	1	61067	110	19	0	7

This is video #1 in the Data School series, "Introduction to Git and GitHub." The full transcript is below. Playlist: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IBLMp7LtN8Nc3Efd4hJq0kD == LET'S CONNECT! == Blog: http://www.dataschool.io Newsletter: http://www.dataschool.io/subscribe/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/justmarkham GitHub: https://github.com/justmarkham == TRANSCRIPT == Welcome to my video series introducing you to Git and GitHub. In this video, we're going to cover the difference between Git and GitHub. Future videos in the series will contain walkthroughs and demos, but this video is largely conceptual. So, what is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a system for version control primarily used by programmers and others who write code. It runs at the command line on your local machine. It allows you to keep track of your files and modifications to those files in something called a repository (or "repo"). For example, here's a repository on my local machine. These are the files and folders being tracked. And here are the last 5 changes to the repo. You can use it alone, or you can use it with a team of people who are working on the same project. It's useful in a team environment because everyone can work independently on those files, merge their changes together, and there is a permanent record of who made which change. So how does GitHub relate to Git? GitHub is a website that allows you to upload your Git repositories online. Why would you do this? Well, it provides a backup of your files. Second, it gives you a visual interface for navigating your repos. Third, it gives other people a way to navigate your repos. And finally, it makes repo collaboration easy. All of these concepts will become much more clear in the upcoming videos. One final note is that Git does not require the use of GitHub. However, it's very common to use GitHub if you are using Git.	27	Education	PT1M56S	116	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xKVlZ3wFVKA/maxresdefault.jpg	1	113422	516	16	0	37

This, according to many experts, would have a far-reaching impact on the job market. Looking at the progression of language models, a few years from now, and with further improvements, many more jobs may find themselves in jeopardy. If the trend continues, analysts are saying that AI software will be able to automate white-collar jobs far before robotics catches up to blue-collar jobs. This is because the innovation in AI models is happening faster than advancements in robotics. This is contrary to previous estimations that blue-collar job workers must learn to code because their jobs will be automated. In this video, we take a look at the different well-paid jobs which language models like GPT-3 may challenge.

OpenAI researchers released a paper describing the development of GPT-3, a state-of-the-art language model made up of 175 billion parameters. The previous OpenAI GPT model had 1.5 billion parameters and was the biggest model back then, which was soon eclipsed by NVIDIA’s Megatron, with 8 billion parameters followed by Microsoft’s Turing NLG that had 17 billion parameters. Now, OpenAI turns the tables by releasing a model that is 10x larger than Turing NLG. Current NLP systems still largely struggle to learn from a few examples. With GPT-3, the researchers show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches.

The pledge — “Rome Call for AI Ethics” is called to ensure that the technology of artificial intelligence is respecting privacy, and is working without bias — has been presented to Pope Francis, on Friday, by the president of Microsoft — Brad Smith, and executive vice president of IBM — John Kelly along with Vatican officials and the Chinese director-general of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisations — Qu Dongyu. The deal focuses on increasing awareness among companies and institutions to set a barricade and a guideline to use ever-changing technology. It involves AI to safeguard the rights of the people concerning biases related to fields of facial recognition used to investigate crime, and AI applied to vet job applicants — both been proved to be inaccurate and a biased software. That is the reason, according to the news report, the pledge has been taken to “humanise technology and not ‘technologise’ humanity.” Read the complete story here: https://analyticsindiamag.com/rome-call-for-ai-ethics-a-humanising-pledge-signed-by-the-tech-giants-the-catholic-church/	28	Science & Technology	PT1M49S	109	2d	hd	false			426	8	1	0	1

However, Specialized domains, such as biomedical text, have their own complexity. Biomedical text typically comprises of two genres - scientific journal articles such as PubMed, and clinical documents. These data sources have a number of characteristics that make it difficult for using NLP – such as presence of parenthesized text, lack of tagged standard data for aforementioned NLP problems, and therapeutic area variance. Additionally, crucial information is present in tables and figures, which are in general difficult for NLP applications to handle. At ZS, the Advanced Data Science Team is at the forefront of solving these challenges and building new applications to drive efficiency in trial operations. In this workshop, we will walk participants through how AI (and NLP in particular) is transforming the pharma R&D landscape. We will then deep-dive into a specific challenge - biomedical entity recognition. Biomedical NER involves identifying biomedical entities such as diseases, drug and chemical compounds, p-values for statistical tests etc. Participants will be acquainted with multiple state of the art methods such as Conditional Random Fields, Bi-LSTM and Tree LSTM co-training that are currently being used to do Biomedical NER.	28	Science & Technology	PT1H59M48S	3588	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dOvl4OSzqNY/maxresdefault.jpg		118	6	0	0	1

It has the same impact as making marketing engine more effective. Reducing churn has the following strategic benefits: • Reduces marketing cost: Acquiring a new customer costs five times or more than that of retaining a customer. • Provides rentention insights: Churn analysis can provide important cues on retention allowing you to keep a tab on customers changing needs and preferences. • Foster long-term relationships and loyalty: By acting on insights from churn analysis, you remove bottlenecks and foster long-term customer relationships. In this churn prediction case study for a music streaming service, we have found that user activity attributes did not identify churning customers but transactional attributes contain potential patterns that help identify customer churn. We developed 10 base models and a two layered ensemble models. The ensemble model was the best and it predicted customers who are likely to churn with an Accuracy of 96% and F1-Score of 86.5%. Chaitanya Sagar is the founder and CEO of Perceptive Analytics. He has a Postgraduate Degree from the Indian School of Business and is a qualified CA and CS.

A consultant may receive hundreds of job requests/ orders every day from their customers from various industries. These request orders can be extremely varied in nature in terms of skill requirements, business domain, experience, region etc. which creates a challenge for the recruitment companies to fulfil these job orders in timely fashion and focus on improving profit margins. Our solution focusses on helping recruiters prioritize job requests based on probability score of request completion thereby increasing fill rate – Number of job request successfully completed and reduce the time-taken, ensuring higher value return with relatively less effort. It also provides automation by eliminating human involvement for classifying job request as low, medium or high priority which is an existing practice, thereby further reducing cost and labour requirements. Our solution is entirely hosted on Azure cloud and leverages native Azure services for data collection, model management and monitoring capabilities. Also, the solution follows the micro- services architecture in terms of model deployment in Azure Kubernetes Service. The solution can be embedded in the recruiter’s applicant tracking system to generate real-time recommendation of complexity vs value. I started my career in 2015 and worked for two years as a Microsoft CRM Developer. In 2018 I found my passion in Data Science and since then I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer for my team in TCS. I work to develop AI applications and use cases for satisfying various business needs that adds value for the stakeholders. I primarily use Python and Microsoft Azure ML as my choice of tools.	28	Science & Technology	PT15M18S	918	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ljZgcbu7onY/maxresdefault.jpg		72	1	0	0	0

Floods are complicated natural events. It depends on several parameters, so it is very difficult to model analytically. The floods in a catchment depends on the characteristics of the catchment, rainfall and antecedent conditions. So the estimation of the flood peak is a very complex problem. Its due to the lack of Flood Prediction System which can predict the situation accurately. To Overcome this challenge we are building a Flood Prediction System using Predictive modelling. However we have divided our idea into small fragments but enough to be used globally. We have considered most flooded state of India, but can be used widely for all the low lying geographical regions. •The plains of Bihar, adjoining Nepal, are drained by a number of rivers that have their catchments in the steep and geologically nascent Himalayas. Kosi, Gandak,Burhi Gandak, Bagmati, Kamla Balan, Mahananda and Adhwara Group of rivers originates in Nepal, carry high discharge and very high sediment load and drops it down in the plains of Bihar. · About 65% of catchments area of these rivers falls in Nepal/Tibet and only 35% of catchments area lies in Bihar. · Bihar is India’s most flood-prone State, with 76 percent of the population, in the north Bihar living under the recurring threat of flood devastation. About 68800 sq Km out of total geographical area of 94163 sq Km comprising 73.06 percent is flood affected. · According to some historical data, 16.5% of the total flood affected area in India is located in Bihar while 22.1% of the flood affected population in India lives in Bihar. · From 1979 to Present day more than 8,873 Humans & 27,573 animals have lost their life due to flood. Some of Tools & Technology which is being used & can be used for Flood Prediction: •IBM. Watson Studio democratizes machine learning and deep learning to accelerate infusion of AI in to drive innovation. •An Intelligent Hydro-informatics Integration Platform for Regional Flood Inundation Warning Systems. •Three-Parameter Muskingum Model Coupled with an Improved Bat Algorithm. · Deep Learning with a Long Short-Term Memory Networks Approach for Rainfall-Runoff Simulation I am a Data Scientist and I thrive in dynamic, high energy and creative work spaces.

In the modern world, data is worth more than gold if meaningful insights are successfully extracted from it. There have been multiple studies that focus on extracting insights from this huge pile of data but none of them provides a satisfactory impact analysis. Impact analysis works like our traditional approach to calculate impact based on social proofing. Our model is capable of processing huge amounts of data from multiple sources like tweets, websites, documents etc., and provides deep insights by identifying the context of the data which has been provided to it. The solution works over Bidirectional Encoder Representations (BERT) which is a neural network-based technique for Natural Language Processing (NLP) pre-training. Initially, the solution is provided with multiple links to the articles which may contain information related to the event over which impact analysis is to be performed. The links can be of multiple sorts like Blogs, News articles, Twitter channels, Hashtags, etc. The solution will go through each individual link and process it based on the type of the link. The more relevant the data sources are, the more relevant would be the end analysis after analyzing all individual resources. We tested our model on “US CHINA TRADE WAR” and used multiple data sources to let the model extract useful insights like – 1.) China’s growing influence in Latin America that threatens America’s dominance”. 2.) More elaborative role in Europe marginalizing Russia’s dominance.

We will begin with an overview of RNNs, LSTMs and encoder-decoder architecture variations. Attention in such models usually leads to accuracy improvements. Hence, we will discuss different attention variants. In the past two years, transformer based models have become more fashionable than recurrent ones. We will discuss transformer networks and then understand how they have been used in BERT, GPT2 and MT-DNN. Some efforts tried to combine the power of recurrent models and transformers leading to short-lived glory in the form of Transformer-XL and XLNet.

Qualitative market research can be valuable when you are developing new marketing initiatives and you want to test reactions on the crowd and refine your approach. One of the powerful qualitative research methodologies is focus group discussion, in which a moderator assembles a group of individuals to discuss a specific topic, aiming to draw conclusions from complex personal experiences, beliefs, perceptions, opinions and attitudes of the participants through a moderated interaction. Focus group interviews are extensively leveraged in sectors like CPR and health- care. Focus Group discussion aids the Consumer Product and Retail sector (CPR) to learn the market pulse and develop better marketing strategies to resonate with the customers and boost the sales. An extensive range of topics central to health and illness has been studied using focus groups including the experience of specific disorders and diseases, violence and abuse, health care practices and procedures, health-related behaviours, and broader factors that mediate health and illness. Focus group discussions are conducted by moderators who keep the group “focused” and generate a lively and in-depth productive discussion to obtain a balanced input from a diverse group of people. The moderators should take notes of the discussion, analyse the opinions & expressions of participants and arrive at conclusions based on the observations. A biased opinion of the moderator could tamper the business as well as the relationship with the customers. In this paper, we devise a methodology to automate the role of the moderator in the Focus group discussions using Artificial intelligence. The proposed solution uses Machine Learning and Deep Learning to process the video and audio streams of a Focus Group recording to emulate the moderator's role. It summarizes the discussion with the facial expressions and tonality of participants being analysed and co-processed with the participant's positive and negative sentiments on the topics discussed. This implementation helps in reducing the manual effort put in by the moderator and the cost incurred in conducting the discussions. The solution would also eliminate any human bias by the moderator to arrive at an unbiased conclusion. This solution incorporates Neural networks, Machine Learning & Computer vision modules to perform facial emotion detection, sentiment analysis, tonality analysis and topic modelling.

This has led to a proportional growth for the e-commerce logistics (e-logistics) supply chain in the country. With this exponential growth, India is strategically positioned very nicely to solve for some of the most challenging problems facing the logistics industry, test the products in one of the toughest markets and take these solutions to the world. As one of the largest players in the e-logistics space, the depth and breadth of data produced in the network is huge. For e.g. over 50 million geo-codes are produced daily, along with additional information tagged to each geo-code; across first mile, mid mile / line haul and last mile legs of the network. Considering our work on the last mile allocation problem for more than 20,000 people across rural and urban India delivering anywhere between 500,000 to 1,000,000+ shipments daily, this paper discusses key tenets and levers of building an AI platform from scratch and specific challenges that are unique to AI products. “Last Mile” leg of the e-logistics supply chain in India contributes to about 30% of the entire delivery cost of a shipment and is a tough problem to solve, primarily because of variable demand and poor localization of customer addresses. Typical last-mile delivery model of an e-logistics company includes segregating geographic routes of a last mile center (serviceability) and one or more delivery executive/subcontractor assigned to these routes for deliveries. To achieve better unit economics or generate higher flexible capacity, some of these routes are also subcontracted to local “mom and pop” stores, since they can cross utilize their staff for doing local deliveries. However, the capacity of both local stores and delivery executives is limited and there is a cost and reliability difference between the two. Hence, to minimize the cost of last-mile deliveries and maintain appropriate service levels, an e-logistics company must determine an optimal allocation of shipments to their fixed fleet and to the sub-contractors. Other factors to system driven allocation include ensuring fairness and equal opportunity, utilizing local ground intelligence, complexity of delivering a shipment etc. Rishit Jain is working as a Product Manager(Strategy) with the Data Sciences and Artificial Intelligence team at Delhivery, India’s largest ecommerce logistics provider. His charter includes building an AI driven logistics platform to help Delhivery’s ground operations be highly efficient and optimized, with the immediate focus on last-mile operations. Rishit was earlier working as a Senior Product Data Manager with Boeing for their 2nd century digital transformation data products; prior to which, as a Product Manager, he helped Hitachi create an end to end analytics based Manufacturing Execution System.

Comparing the proposed method's accuracy with basic memory-based techniques and latent factor model. Making accurate predictions for unknown ratings in sparse matrices based on the proposed method. More users are satisfied of the group recommender system's performance. Memory-based collaborating filtering techniques are widely used in recommender systems. They are based on full initial ratings in a user-item matrix. However, most of the time in group recommender systems, this matrix is sparse and users' preferences are unknown. Recommendation systems are widely used in conjunction with many popular personalized services, which enables people to find not only content items they are currently interested in, but also those in which they might become interested. Many recommendation systems employ the memory-based collaborative filtering (CF) method, which has been generally accepted as one of consensus approaches. Despite the usefulness of the CF method for successful recommendation, several limitations remain, such as sparsity and cold-start problems that degrade the performance of CF systems in practice. To overcome these limitations, a content-metadata-based approach is suitable that uses content-metadata in an effective way. By complementarily combining content-metadata with conventional user-content ratings and trust network information, the approach remarkably increases the amount of suggested content and accurately recommends a large number of additional content items. Experimental results show a significant enhancement of performance.

This is leading to numerous wind power plants being set up all over the world. These power plants rely on the available wind energy for power generation. To harness all the possible energy from the wind, the rotor needs to be perpendicularly aligned with respect to the direction in which the wind is blowing. This is done through a control system called Yaw mechanism. The wind turbine is said to have a yaw error, if the rotor is not perpendicular to the wind. The share of energy that can be harnessed from the wind, drops at the rate of cosine of the yaw error. Thus, the correction of yaw errors is necessary to ensure lowered losses and optimized generation. The usual detection techniques include intuitive guesses made by expert site engineers working at the wind farm and through observation of generation patterns. These techniques are at their best, approximations of the actual scenario and only detectable when there are really large yaw errors. The delay in detection in these manual methods amounts to approximately 12% of loss in energy generation. This paper explains how machine learning is being used to detect yaw error right after its onset, identify the root cause and quantify the consequent energy lost. The detection of yaw misalignment is done by analyzing the wind direction, nacelle position and yaw angle data captured by the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system installed at the wind power plant. This analysis is then augmented with statistical tests to rule out errors in measurement and ascertain that the data is indeed indicating yaw misalignment. When the results prove to be statistically significant, the next step is to identify the root cause for the misalignment, so that an appropriate corrective action can be recommended to the site engineers. The probable root causes are presence of a faulty sensor, wrongly calibrated sensor or low yaw speed. These root causes are identified through pattern recognition algorithms, that look for different signatures, that each one leaves in the data. A non-linear regression model is then trained to learn the pattern of energy generation of a turbine in healthy condition. This model is then used to predict the energy generation of the turbine for which yaw misalignment has been observed. The difference in the actual and predicted values is the estimate of loss in power generation due to yaw misalignment. The adoption of this algorithm has helped in early identification of yaw errors and take corrective actions in near real time, thus preventing the loss in energy generation of up to 7-9% annually.

The estimated impact of predicting these events and addressing the leakages can be in the range of millions, to even billions of dollars. Machine learning approaches are being increasingly used to predict these customer events accurately. Feature engineering, and selection is core to these approaches. Typically, there is extensive effort undertaken to handcraft features and manually iterate through alternate models. However, this is increasingly challenging given the increasing volume, dimensionality and temporal nature of the data. Domain experts can hypothesize relevant factors to consider for specific customer events, but, identifying the right set of feature across numerous permutations is a matter of conjecture and combinatorically complex. Automated feature engineering and discovery approaches offer a viable alternative for handling this combinatorial complexity in an optimal manner. In this session, we seek to present an approach to that effect, inspired by evolutionary algorithms and key considerations in enabling it at scale.

Tree-based approaches 2 are very popular due to their inherent ability in being visually representable for decision consumption as well as robustness and reduced training times. However, tree-based approaches lack the ability to generate variations in regression problems. The maximum variation generated by any single tree-based model is limited to the maximum number of training observations considering each observation to be a terminal node itself. Such a condition is an overfit model. This paper discusses the use of a hybrid approach of using two intuitive and explainable algorithms, CART 2 and k-NN 3 regression to improve the generalizations and sometimes the runtime for regression-based problems. The paper proposes first, the use of using a shallow CART algorithm (Tree depth lesser than optimal depth post pruning). Following the initial CART, a KNN Regression is performed at the terminal node to which the observation for prediction generation belongs to. This leads to a better variation as well as more accurate prediction than by just the use of a CART or a KNN regressor as well as another level of depth over an OLS regression.

AI is fast becoming integral to our daily lives - from image to facial recognition systems, machine learning powered predictive and prescriptive analytics, hyper-personalized systems, conversational applications, autonomous vehicles, identification of symptoms across diseases - the applications are numerous. With such a heavy reliance on the capabilities of AI, the need to trust these AI systems with all aspects of decision making is becoming critical. The predictions and prescriptions churned out by AI enabled systems are having a tremendous impact on how we view and experience life, death, and personal wellness. This is especially true of AI systems used in healthcare, driverless cars, or even drones deployed during warfare. However, most of us have little visibility and knowledge on how AI systems make the decisions they do. In the absence of this clarity, it is even more difficult to comprehend how the results are being applied and consumed across various fields. Many of the techniques and algorithms used for machine learning are either virtually opaque, or defy easy examination. This is largely true for most of the popular algorithms currently in use; specifically, deep learning neural network approaches. Fortunately for us, there is an aspect of AI, called Explainable AI, which can direct computer systems to operate as expected, and generate transparent explanations for decisions they make. In the future we will need to focus more on the Explainable AI component in order to further build our trust on AI systems that are used in decision-making. In this presentation, we will explore various algorithms, and techniques, that support ease of comprehension, and interpretability, of these machine learning models.

With the changes in business strategy, personalized product recommendation has become an integral part of the customer experience journey. There has been extensive research leveraging collaborative filtering, market basket analysis and various other machine- learning / deep-learning based solutions for developing recommendation engines. The features such as customer behavior, historically purchased items, characteristics of similar users, etc. are used as inputs to the machine learning pipelines. In this paper, we present a novel approach using Graph algorithms for building a product recommendation solution for a publishing company. The publishing company has footprints with its customized education content, software and services at many world-renowned institutes and universities across the world. However, the company is experiencing a significant churn rate for their online platform for learning which is subscribed by various institutes. The developed solution is an ensemble of insights generated from several graph algorithms for centrality (personalized PageRank, betweenness & degree algorithm) and community detection (Louvain, strongly connected components, etc.) to control churn with product recommendation being the key step. The approach for recommendation generation for courses and books is based on the overall influential power of various other institutes and associated instructors in the network. Simultaneously, the approach focuses on the popular books and courses inside a local community identified by the graph algorithms to generate recommendations.

According to a recent survey, 85% of users read reviews of products , and 68% of them say they rely on reviews when making purchasing decisions. An incorrect or misleading review can turn out to be disastrous for customers who have fallen prey to fake positive reviews or conversely for the businesses losing potential customers basis spurious negative reviews posted by competitors or some unscrupulous agents. Sentiment Analysis (SA) / Opinion Mining(OM) has become one of the most essential components of text analytics due to its promising commercial benefits. One of the main issues in OM apart from extracting emotions and polarity is to detect fake positive reviews and negative reviews. Amazon says that out of the 1.8 million unverified reviews posted in March 2019, 99.6% were five-star. By comparison, during 2017-2018, the number of unverified reviews averaged fewer than 300,000 per month and only 75% were five-star. This talk will focus on 1. The ever-increasing problem of fake reviews and challenges in identifying them. 2. Annotating fake reviews 3. General framework for identifying fake reviews. 4. NLP techniques that can be leveraged for identifying fake reviews. Vinodhini is currently a Senior data scientist @Cisco.

With the advent of newer technology with greater computing power, big data and contemporary media channels, organizations have realized the importance of marketing mix modelling (MMM) and identified the benefits it entails that gives rise to cost saving opportunities and drives profitability. Marketers are under increasing pressure to move away from intuition based budgeting decisions to factual budgeting decisions, substantiated through quantitative evidence. In an attempt to understand how their marketing activities connect with real movements in sales and market share, the client, an Australian subsidiary of one of the world’s largest automotive manufacturer, wanted to conduct a MMM exercise and arrive at a clearer understanding of their Return on Marketing Investment. The client’s marketing strategy was designed around the themes of Media, Messaging and Brand Equity. Various levers were identified under each of these themes which are essentially the components of the marketing mix, to help assess the relative impact of marketing on enquiry and sales of the client’s product. Using historical marketing and sales data under each of the exhaustive components identified, Analyttica helped estimate the relative influence of the various components of the marketing mix, while controlling for other sales drivers such as seasonality. Proper capturing of the event and longevity of effect of the media channels on the outcome (in this case unit sales), is paramount for the success of any MMM application, which is heavily dependent on the suitable selection of the transformations such as decay (simple, logarithmic, exponential etc.), logistic, AdStock, and gamma. The appropriate selection of these transformation functions is highly contextual and driven by the skills, experience, knowledge and judgment of the modeler. As a surrogate to the knowledge, skill and experience of the modeler, we developed a heuristic optimization methodology for selection of the transformation functions for the media channels. The methodology considered six transformation functions competing against each other to arrive at the most appropriate one, that reduced the error of the model. This method is automated and has been developed into a prototype that can be applied in similar situations towards the process of measuring “Above the Line” (ATL) marketing effectiveness and optimization. The above exercise highlighted the potential costs and benefits of all the components, which was then weighed against one another in order to build a media mix solution, to arrive at the effectiveness of each of the ATL channels, to enable the decisions around objective allocation of the marketing budget across channels. Madhav Kaushik has 12 years of experience in analytics and data science fields, across different industry verticals, with domain expertise in the Banking and Financial Services industry. At Analyttica, he leads the client solutions and product strategy group, providing data science solutions across the customer life cycle, from acquisition to customer engagement to risk mitigation. He has spent a significant part of his career in a variety of roles in companies such as Fidelity and Genpact, enabling business impact through the application of analytics and data science. He has a Master’s in Economics from Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, Pune and a BA (Hons) from Delhi University.	28	Science & Technology	PT29M21S	1761	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1GpMBHpTmA8/maxresdefault.jpg		48	0	1	0	0

Our paper gives complete solution to above mentioned critical issues using computer vision technology. i)Driver drowsiness is detected using an IR LED based tracking approach so that drowsiness can be detected in odd hours(mid-night) also,which is fitted inside the engine cab.This method is based on the spatial-temporal relationship which would detect the drowsiness more accurately.If the drowsiness is detected then a level I alarm is sounded. ii)Using a long range camera which is placed on the train engine,images are continuously monitored using streaming technique with a well trained object de- tection deep learning model using tensorflow as back-end to detect obstacles on the train track.Once an obstacle is detected a level II alarm is sent to the driver. This automized system helps the driver to be more productive in his job by helping him in the emergency situations to act quickly and in turn help save lives. In addition to saving lives this system also helps the Indian Railways in terms of monetary benefits by saving a lot of operational cost.

A persuasive description can lead to conversion while a feeble one can steer a prospect towards competitors. A copywriter makes a compelling pitch by personalizing the description and tempting the prospect by using sensory words. He provides crisp benefits of product rather than making unproved claims. In this paper, I want to present an automated mechanism to assess the quality of product descriptions by scoring the usage of personal, sensorial, functional and superlatives in a description. This categorization is achieved through lexical, syntactic and contextual NLP techniques. Degree of personalization is measured by using constituency parser and synsets(wordnet). Sensorial context is confirmed using sentence encoder. Functional categorization is based on Open Information Extraction & Coreference Resolution. Verification of claims is done using POS tagging and pertainyms(wordnet). The quality of product description is presented using a normalized weighted measurement of degree of usage of personal, sensorial, functional and superlatives in a description.

The complexity of the ad-tech ecosystem is constantly growing with brands running marketing activities across multiple channels, new targeting capabilities, and formats. Due to this, traditional digital measurement metrics like cost per click, return on investment, cost per conversion, etc. just scratch the surface while measuring the impact of marketing strategies. This measurement gap leads us to look at the incremental lift as a metric to measure the impact of a marketing strategy. Incrementality testing is a mathematical approach to differentiate between correlation and causation. We formulated different approaches to calculate incremental lift that can be implemented in the digital marketing ecosystem. Viewability is one of the methodologies that we are using for calculating incrementality in which we are measuring the effectiveness of an ad by comparing the users who are exposed to an ad versus users that are not exposed to an ad. Our methodologies cover concepts of test environment setup, randomization, bias handling, hypothesis testing, primary output and understanding different ways of using this output. We used this output for strategy planning and optimizations, helping us in achieving higher campaign efficiency. Having a set of different approaches to calculate incrementality gives us the flexibility to cater to a wide range of test cases having different setup challenges and restrictions.

The body produces larger quantities of the chemical cortisol and they trigger an increased heart rate, heightened muscle preparedness, sweating and alertness. Emotional stress is a primary factor to the six leading causes of death. It is a feeling of emotional or physical tension that makes a person feel frustrated, angry and nervous. They can be positive when it helps to avoid risk or meet a deadline. But when the stress lasts for a long time, it may ruin our health. To refrain from this situation, the individuals recognized with stress pattern are asked to listen to soft music and the brainwave pattern is recorded in response. We use neural network architectures with attention mechanism to identify the pattern and predict the emotional state of a person. I completed my undergraduate in Information Technology at Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology, Chennai. Projects: ➢ Worked on Distributed Tensorflow to run Neural Network models in a cluster which reduces the training time and supports huge models to fit in memory. ➢ Worked on identifying similar training phrases across various chat intents using BERT embeddings. ➢ Working on the Chatbot AI Testing tool to identify where the bot’s conversational flow is disconnected and generating user phrases to test the bot using Text Generation.	28	Science & Technology	PT29M34S	1774	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vQwQTj19-6o/maxresdefault.jpg		571	16	0	0	5

Back in the 1990s, statistical machine learning methods began to replace the classical top-down rule-based approach to interpret languages, primarily due to accurate results, speed of processing and robustness of the algorithms. The advent of faster processors in the 2010s exponentially improved the performance of NLP algorithms. The need for clean and labeled training data also grew along with the emergence of faster processors and robust algorithms to improve the accuracy of the models. Statistical approaches have turned another corner and are now strongly focused on the usage of deep neural networks to both perform inferences on specific linguistic tasks and for developing robust algorithms. This paper By Abhishek Bhadra AVP at Genpact, Prakash Selvakumar AVP at Genpact, focuses on a machine learning approach to perform word segmentation and Hierarchy detection on medical documents (in form of any editable digital documents like PDFs). When text is extracted from digital pdf using python libraries such as PDFMiner, the output is in the form of Scriptio continua - a style of writing without spaces between the words or sentences. One of the ways to use this unseparated raw text in a meaningful way is known as word segmentation, which is a process to determine the word boundaries in a sentence. In this paper, they present a machine learning approach to build a word segmentation algorithm and also find the hierarchical structure in the text (for example Header1 or Header2 etc.). They leveraged the English Wikipedia dataset to build and train this advanced sequence to sequence model. The technique used in this paper has been successfully tested on medical domain data. We have also observed significant improvement in model accuracy by further training the algorithm with domain-specific documents (in the form of PDFs) ___________ Abhishek Bhadra is a seasoned Analytics expert and Bilingual AI/ML Practitioner. His distinguished career spans more than 14 years with a proven track record in driving disruption through augmented analytics across multiple Fortune 500 companies.

Today most of the companies invest a lot in creating NLP models for their needs. It is customized for their needs. So Scaling the NLP model to other teams is always a challenge. Each time a team has to analyses the data and write the NLP algorithm for the data. Solution: To address this problem, I am proposing a solution that creates a Standard NLP framework that just needs the data of the customer. Customers do not need to invest more in creating NLP models and algorithms. Instead, they can just submit their data to NLP framework that automatically learns the intent And develop an algorithm for the particular data.	28	Science & Technology	PT32M14S	1934	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8K1GCdhqFRA/maxresdefault.jpg		134	0	0	0	0

Automatic short answer grading (ASAG) is the task of assessing short natural language responses questions using computational methods. Short Answers tests the ability of the student’s recall using natural language, unlike multiple-choice questions that evaluate only recognition. However, there is no easy way to evaluate short answers, resulting in manual evaluation and feedback putting an enormous burden on teachers in resource constraint countries like India. In this paper, Bharath Kumar Bolla Senior Data Scientist at Happiest Minds will be presenting their research into this aspect by combining conventional and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods which include various embeddings that range from word level, sentence level and contextual. We are also presenting a comprehensive evaluation of various embedding techniques (word2vec, FastText, ELMo, Skip-Thoughts, Quick-Thoughts, FLAIR embeddings, InferSent, Google’s Universal Sentence Encoder and BERT with respect to short text similarity. Our method helps in evaluating natural language-based short answers resulting in instant feedback for students. We also combined Explainable AI (XAI) insights on the logic behind scoring an answer thus providing feedback and improving our models.	28	Science & Technology	PT32M7S	1927	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NXn6oGMMbqo/maxresdefault.jpg		175	5	0	0	1

Also, due to the complex regulations and compliances, the Healthcare and Life Sciences industry are known to be slow in the adoption of Text analytics and Natural Language Processing. Adoption of Natural Language Processing in Healthcare and Life Sciences Industries - A perspective on NextGen of Industry By Prathamesh Karmalkar Principal Data Scientist at Merck talks about how Industries are facing significant challenges in analyzing the data due to its unstructured textual nature. Because of massive digital disruption across the globe, there is a sharp rise in the generation of naturally written forms of electronic data. This explosive growth of unstructured clinical data, medical data, regulatory data, and healthcare data has prioritized the use of innovative technologies of NLP and Text Analytics. The key challenges in the adoption of NLP are – the exponential growth in unstructured data in the form of unstructured texts from various business teams within the organization. This ever-growing data remains untouched to identify actionable insights and recommendations that can generate significant value for consumers and patients across the globe. Therefore, detecting potential actions and recommendations from unstructured data could be the key difference in serving up the right insights or deep dive into untouched behavior and actions of physicians and patients. Along with this, the advent in the internet and IoT devices is also generating a significant amount of data for creating additional value in the market using Natural Language Processing. Many healthcare and life sciences business organizations are progressively moving towards adopting AI-driven NLP and Text Analytics capabilities which would help get improved and near-real-time insights in unstructured data to derive better results for improved performance across products.

We are living in a world where every aspect of our life is shaped by technology. Through diligent research, new technologies are developed and then used to improve the well-being of every aspect of one’s life. In the case of #naturaldisasters such as a flood, earthquake, or hurricane and even stampede, there is always a challenge in treating the victims on time and this could be because of the shortage of medical staff at relief camps and the victim being stuck at a remote location etc. The Global Call for Code challenge provides a platform to developers across the globe towards leveraging their coding skills in creating solutions along the theme of natural disaster preparedness and relief. Driven by the passion to "Code for a Cause". Pragun and Rachit, two young developers from IBM Software Labs developed Virtual Aid as a part of the Call For Code. VirtualAid is the first means of help to the people affected during a natural disaster from medical staff who can't be physically present in the disaster-prone area. In the session, the presenters will demonstrate the capabilities of VirtualAid and discuss how the power of Watson APIs was leveraged in the development of the solution. The solution employs a programmed Drone mounted with a Pi Camera and the object detection module implemented within the Rasberry-Pi to differentiate between living things and non-living things. #IBM Watson Visual Recognition service is used for image processing and the victim's responses are processed through Watson Speech to Text service and Sentiment Analysis performed by Watson's #NLP Service. The developers will share their experience of developing Virtual Aid and discuss key learning along the way	28	Science & Technology	PT34M1S	2041	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cStCnRST_9M/maxresdefault.jpg		113	2	0	0	0

Many of you might be sort of considered domain experts here and you write them in Python or saw a SAS MATLAB you know these languages tend to be typically dynamic in nature interactive easy to use and then typically for development because the dynamic languages are slow and they don't they're not high-performance you end up rewriting the programs in C++ C sharp Java you know whichever one you want to you know deploy our solution in and it's inefficient right in order for companies to actually win in the market. The basic idea is, you need to take your products and get them to market the fastest so if you did not need to write your application twice write one in Python or R or MATLAB and then again in C++ what if you could have the ease of use of the dynamic languages and the performance of the deployed languages? this is the motivation with which we designed the Julia language so you know it gives you immense levels of performance while being simultaneously easy to use.	28	Science & Technology	PT39M25S	2365	2d	hd	false			1304	29	0	0	1

Artificial intelligence is set to disrupt the job market for all types of industries, changing the way we run our operations, businesses, and dealing with existing or new customers. New kinds of workers will be fundamental, working along with robots and increasing automation to drive company-wide AI strategies. However, it is also true that many companies and employees may not be prepared for AI advancements and significant cultural change. Even as it causes declines in some jobs, automation will change much more. Research says that in about 60% of jobs, at least 30% of the job activities could be automated, which highlights substantial workplace transformations and changes for all future workers. As a result, modern organizations need to accomplish more in arranging for the upcoming employment disruption, and how workers need to get ready for the automation age. The preparation is crucial because AI is estimated to impact workers at all skills and training levels, and the first target will be to get rid of repetitive functions and then move towards augmented intelligence that enhances the human brain. As a result, experts do not doubt that AI will uproot a few job roles, and make new types of jobs in light of the movements in profitability and client requirements. On the other hand, it will also bring ground-breaking new tools for the workforce that can enhance efficiency at different levels. Businesses are, therefore comprehending retraining workers to address foreseen interruption in the job market.Hence the question arises, How To Prepare For The Age Of Artificial Intelligence? know more at https://analyticsindiamag.com/reskilling-at-scale-how-to-prepare-for-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/	28	Science & Technology	PT26S	26	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_P2fbx6LPy4/maxresdefault.jpg		211	4	0	0	0

Drone controllers usually bring the drone near the ground and then drop it. How low the drone can be brought down depends on the aerodynamics of the drone and other reactions from the ground. Since drones of the future will be carrying medicines and other fragile instruments into mysterious landscapes or hilly areas, dropping the drone isn’t always desirable. To address this problem of smooth landing, researchers at CalTech’sCenter for Autonomous Systems and Technologies (CAST), have imbibed neural networks into their approaches. At CAST, artificial intelligence experts are developing a system that uses a deep neural network to help autonomous drones “learn” how to land more safely and quickly, while consuming less power.

The challenges of transferring huge amount of data from field to one central computing infrastructure is prohibitively costly specially when we look at Telecom Networks. Building such costly infrastructure consisting of fat data pipes negates the cost case and expected RoI. Also both in Telco and IoT context, often the data is sensitive and private which imposes additional restriction on data transfer. The first part focusses on such challenges from real-world large scale implementation experiences. The talk then moves to on the emerging solutions for such challenges by employing Federated learning whereby the volume of data transfer is drastically reduced and all of the limited data moving across the network is effectively secured as only computed weights are shared through a secure aggregation mechanism. The talk also shares benefits of such methodology with some indicative comparison of accuracy and benefits The talk is followed by a technical session in the afternoon , where Data Scientists will guide a technical audience to code a FL algorithm on simulated data and compare performances of Centralized vs Federated models	28	Science & Technology	PT24M22S	1462	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/26Mx1NruSLo/maxresdefault.jpg		187	4	0	0	1

Judges use this score as an input while deciding the quantum of punishment given to the criminal. However, data shows that the algorithm predicts higher risk for a black criminal compared to a white criminal who has committed the same offense and has a similar history of crime. Google’s image search algorithm could not differentiate between gorillas and dark-complexioned human beings, producing many offensive search results. Google has now “switched off” the search for gorilla, chimpanzee and similar labels in their image search algorithm. Traditionally, we tend to label these kinds of issues as “algorithmic biases” and try to fix the algorithms. But the reality is that it is the inherent bias in data on which the model is trained, which in turn is a result of past human behaviour, that has led to these erroneous results. We call this “inductive bias”. While the above examples are extreme cases, inductive bias can creep into ML models that we develop for day-to-day business purposes, leading to wrong insights and counter-productive actions. For instance, in the developing countries, auto insurance premium prediction models tend to recommend higher premiums for customers living in less-affluent neighbourhoods. The origin of inductive bias lies in human bias and results don’t seem suspicious at first sight. But as ML and AI become mainstream in business and society, from potentially large business losses to unfair punishments and even loss of lives in extreme cases, inductive bias may be wreaking havoc without us realizing it. How do we overcome inductive bias? The solution to overcoming inductive bias lies in the emerging field of Data Ethnography, a cross-section of Data Science and Ethnography. Just like Ethnography provides insights into human behaviour, Data Ethnography provides insights into the behaviour of data that is being fed into the model and helps fix any inherent biases. Just like Excel and SQL, Data Ethnography is going to be an essential skill for Data Scientists and Data Engineers in the immediate future.	28	Science & Technology	PT27M8S	1628	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q6f5DRbvgp0/maxresdefault.jpg		170	7	0	0	0

Non-adoption of those can put them in disadvantageous trajectories. Enterprises fail to capture the true potential of ML and AI because of:  Suboptimal approaches due to lack of contextualization of ML and AI to their businesses.  Slow adoption due to the complexities involved in connecting to different data, tools, technologies, techniques, and, nuances of deployment at scale.  Lack of disciplined approaches, operating in silos, and limited collaboration amongst functions and teams.  Ineffective traditional methods to institutionalize the experiences and learnings as well as significant dependencies on human talent. An analytics eco-system that is self-sufficient within an organization and enables all the stake- holders to strive towards a common goal is a solution. In this talk Satyamoy will dwell on the different components of an analytics ecosystem and how Analyttica is operating at the confluence of “Analytics experience”, “Data science expertise”, and “Technology excellence” to create significant value for enterprises in their ML & AI endeavors by via an adaptive analytics ecosystem.	28	Science & Technology	PT25M13S	1513	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y4BzZSHNfN0/maxresdefault.jpg		112	2	0	0	0

This talk will demystify Deep Learning and provide insights on how by understanding the Mathematical and Programming Architecture behind it, we can make AI systems Explainable. The talk will illustrate how by understanding the mathematical optimization methods behind deep learning algorithms we can understand the Machine’s decision making process. Banking in simple terms is all about using deposits made by public for lending and investments. When decisions are taken in a Bank using savings from public, it’s quite natural that those decisions need to be explainable. This is a straight forward expectation from all banking regulators. Hence by being able to interpret and explain how an algorithm took a financial decision is key to getting the green signal from regulators on using Deep Learning algorithms for applications in Banking services.	28	Science & Technology	PT30M6S	1806	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NOh7Y5ZFvgY/maxresdefault.jpg		206	13	0	0	1

Due to this, traditional digital marketing measurement metrics like cost per click, return on investment, cost per conversion, etc just scratch the surface while measuring the impact of marketing strategies. Lack of a mathematical approach to differentiate between correlation and causation leads us to look at the incremental lift as a metric to measure the impact of marketing strategy. In this session, we will introduce incremental lift measurement, talk about common challenges faced in calculating incremental lift and different approaches to tackling them in the digital marketing ecosystem. Our methodologies cover concepts of various A/B testing environment setups, randomization, bias handling, delivering outputs at scale and how we use these outputs for marketing strategy planning and optimizations helping us achieve higher campaign efficiency.	28	Science & Technology	PT1H1M17S	77	2d	hd	false			122	3	0	0	0

Truly speaking, this is the best front camera I have experienced so far. From this review, we can understand two things. First, the customer holds a positive opinion about the phone. Secondly, the front camera of the phone is the targeted feature on which the opinions have been expressed in the review. In this workshop, we will be particularly interested in discovering patterns as indicated in the second case. We will discuss a framework that enables us to first discover the targets on which the opinions have been expressed in a review and then determine the polarity of the opinions. This kind of detailed analysis helps us to discover the components or features of the products which the customers have liked or disliked and thus help us to better summarize the information.	28	Science & Technology	PT48M13S	2893	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/blqs3JYaFmU/maxresdefault.jpg		129	4	0	0	0

Hear him on the topic - AI for Enterprises-The Value Paradigm AI is here, call it a buzz, call it a bubble, we are smack in the middle of an AI revolution. While there is a strong view building about consumer AI applications, there still seems to be some scepticism about AI for enterprises, primarily due to the lack of clarity and focus on how AI can actually deliver value for enterprises. At BRIDGEi2i, we believe it is important to have a non-fragmented view of the AI ecosystem and a “Value Roadmap” for AI in the enterprise context. As CxOs, it is important to understand where the enterprise is in the transformation journey and define value accordingly. This talk will throw light on how to look at the enterprise AI ecosystem and build the right roadmap for value.

In most cases, machine intelligence is being used as a supplement to human decision making, thereby “augmenting” human intelligence. In this context Augmented Intelligence is proving to be more critical rather than Artificial Intelligence. Augmented Intelligence is also critical in considering the real-life constraints in leveraging machine intelligence within business context. Business leaders look at Augmented Intelligence as the next competitive edge to drive incremental top-line or bottom-line impact in their organisations. However, the path from “Data” to “Dollars” (business benefits) is time- intensive and full of challenges. Like an iceberg, the steps that require significant time and effort are mostly hidden under the water. Hence, the process of generating “Dollars” from “Data” appears exceptionally slow and frustrating to most business leaders. What if, we could navigate the entire data-to-dollar path in an agile manner? What if, we could get a data lake up and running in less than 15 days and create data marts in less than 30 days and have models implemented within 45 days? And last but not the least what if we could empower the business managers to do all the above themselves? The Actify Data Labs session will outline the agile approach and the tools needed for generating “Dollars” from “Data” at an extremely fast pace. And illustrate the same with a case study for consumer businesses within the Indian context.

Analytics India Guru Explains	Widely used in techniques like signal processing and image classification techniques, CNN usually dominates computer vision techniques because of its accuracy in image classification. Needless to say, CNN has been one of the most influential innovations in the field of computer vision and started gaining immense popularity since 2012 when Alex Krizhevsky used them to win that year’s ImageNet competition, which is basically the annual Olympics of computer vision. In this Hindi explainer video, we dig deeper into understanding what is CNN and how does it work. To understand more concepts around CNN here are links to some of our older articles: Overview of CNN in Image Classification: https://www.analyticsindiamag.com/convolutional-neural-network-image-classification-overview/ Learn Image Classification using CNN in Keras with Code: https://www.analyticsindiamag.com/learn-image-classification-using-cnn-in-keras-with-code/ Types of Activation Functions in Neural Networks: https://www.analyticsindiamag.com/most-common-activation-functions-in-neural-networks-and-rationale-behind-it/ How to create your first Artificial Neural Network in Python: https://www.analyticsindiamag.com/most-common-activation-functions-in-neural-networks-and-rationale-behind-it/ Stay tuned for more Hindi explainers in analytics, data science and AI! -------------------------------------------------- Get in touch with us: Website: www.analyticsindiamag.com Contact: info@analyticsindiamag.com Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AnalyticsIndiaMagazine/ Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/analyticsindiam Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10283931/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/analyticsindiamagazine/	28	Science & Technology	PT4M2S	242	2d	hd	false		1	14651	446	16	0	37

In this talk, we describe how the fundamental technologies such as automatic speech recognition and natural language understanding are being used to create these new experiences. Bixby is Samsung's AI Platform the core of which is Bixby Voice – an intelligent, personalized Assistant that enables users to use Voice for Samsung or 3rd party services. Bixby learns, evolves, and adapts to you to help you get things done seamlessly. Each feature of Bixby is designed to make your life easier, whether it's through touch, type, or voice. We talk about the evolution of Bixby Voice & associated research & development work at Samsung (including R&D centers in India). We talk about challenges in domain & intent classification for Natural Language understanding, and Deep Learning based solutions ranging from CNN vs. RNNs, Word vs. Character based models, Handling of variations of data and conflicts between data. We also describe recent efforts and results in improving speech recognition (ASR) performance for end users of Samsung's Bixby voice assistant. One of the main challenges with ASR is speaker variability. Different users, depending on their style, accent and other traits can pronounce the same word or sentence in many different ways. Hence, a one-size-fits-all approach works poorly for some segment of users, even though aggregate ASR performance may be quite high. Specifically, we present two techniques of improving ASR performance by considering the end user. The first is implemented at a macro level and uses a Hierarchical Accent Determination system dealing with accent variations. For English, eight accents [GB, US, Australian, Canadian, Spanish, Korean, and Indian & Chinese] are identified at macro level and accent-specific models corresponding to the identified accents are used. Similar approaches are applicable for languages like Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, which have significant accent variations at regional level. The second technique involves adapting the ASR models for a particular end user. Here, we describe how the acoustic model can be enhanced for a particular user's speaking style by training a new model on-device for that user. The key challenges in this problem are how to select utterances for training and adaptation, how to generate ground truth labels and handle errors in ground truth estimation. ______________________________________ VIKRAM VIJ Sr. Vice President atSamsung R&D Institute Dr. Vikram Vij received a Ph.D. and Master’s degree from the University of California Berkeley in Computer Science, an M.B.A. degree from Santa Clara University and a B.Tech. degree from IIT Kanpur in Electronics.

However, one must be cognizant about any unintended consequences of using this technology. The unseen harm that AI can cause is them reflecting our human biases in the data sets the organisations collect. There would be a compounding effect during the emergence of AI, as the algorithms exhibit self-learning from data. To fight this prejudice, I would talk about aspects like diversity inclusive mindset for data collection, the possibility of building and taking AI to an elevated level and recognising the vitality involved with AI training systems.

Visit us at: https://www.analyticsindiamag.com _________________________________________________ Bharat Light & Power Pvt Ltd (BLP Group) is a leading renewable energy generation and technology company in India. My talk will revolve around how AI, ML and Augmented Analytics are being employed by our organization for renewable energy, manufacturing and utilities sector for downtime reduction, preventive maintenance, energy management, bringing about automation, inventory optimization, manufacturing cycle time reduction and several other use cases. At BLP Clean Energy, we employ analytics and ML for a holistic approach for renewable energy asset performance monitoring, analysis and prediction of impending failures of components of assets. Our approach is a confluence of machine learning for prediction of assets’ behavioural trends in future, streaming data mining to spot and notify underperformance as and when it occurs and rule based methods for decision-making. Our predictive intelligence solutions for failure prediction enable prevention of component failures in several cases and in others, readiness at wind and solar farms to handle potential upcoming component failures. This insight in conjunction with estimates of the remaining useful life of components, through machine learning, converts unplanned downtime into planned downtime. Through real time big data analytics on our cognitive computing platform, we ensure remote, automated, regular health assessment of assets. Our analytics solutions enable domain experts on an ongoing basis to chart out precise action plans to alleviate damage from predicted failures and tackle root causes of underperformance which are communicated to Operations and Management teams at the farms through our closed loop workflow on our AI platform. DEEPIKA SANDEEP Head, AI and Analytics at BLP Clean Energy Deepika Sandeep is Head, AI and Analytics Program at BLP Clean Energy. She leads the analytics practice for solar and wind energy asset analytics and management. Prior to this, she worked with analytics divisions in various domains like automotive manufacturing, healthcare and real estate at several organizations – Bosch, TCS Innovation Labs, NTT Data, to name a few.

Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe, Torch, Theano, and MXNet have contributed to the popularity of deep learning by reducing the effort and skills needed to design, train, and use deep learning models. Fabric for Deep Learning (FfDL, pronounced “fiddle”) provides a consistent way to run these deep-learning frameworks as a service on Kubernetes. In this talk ,I will be introducing a framework called Fabric for Deep Learning (FfDL). It uses a microservices architecture to decoupling components, making component simple & stateless, isolate component failures and allowing each component to be developed, tested, deployed, scaled, and upgraded independently.	28	Science & Technology	PT49M36S	2976	2d	sd	false			82	1	0	0	0

In the Unsupervised Learning, we have only data and the outcome has to be discovered in terms of pattern emanating from the data. In today’s environment, often times we have to start with Unsupervised Learning, identify pattern, and then move to Supervised Learning for Predictive Analytics involving Classification. Thus the analytics exercise seems to be a journey from Unsupervised to Supervised Learning. A case study that has the primary goal to identify pattern in terms of attitude and behavior of respondents toward IOT is used as a basis to illustrate the power of analytics that travels from Unsupervised to Supervised Learning. Unsupervised Learning involving Hierarchical Clustering was done using Ward’s Procedure. Three clusters were identified-those who will adopt IOT, those who are undecided, and those who will not adopt IOT. The Clusters have been confirmed by way of differentiation and classification using Fisher’s Discriminant Analysis that is a supervised learning procedure. Jack-Knife Method of cross validation has been done to test the veracity of the model. The insights are not only intriguing but also extremely important in establishing the premise that in “Today’s Environment, the Journey is from Unsupervised to Supervised Machine Learning”.	28	Science & Technology	PT38M33S	2313	2d	sd	false			109	2	0	0	0

However, specialized domains such as biomedical text have their own complexity. Biomedical data sources have a number of characteristics that make it difficult for using NLP – such as the presence of parenthesized text, lack of tagged standard data and therapeutic area variance, information in tables and figures (which are usually difficult for NLP to handle). At ZS, the Advanced Data Science team is at the forefront of solving these challenges and building new applications to drive efficiency in trial operations. In this workshop, we will walk participants through how AI (and NLP in particular) is transforming the pharma R&D landscape. We will then deep-dive into a specific challenge - biomedical entity recognition. Participants will be acquainted with multiple state-of-the-art methods such as Conditional Random Fields and Deep Learning that are currently being used for Biomedical Named Entity Recognition.	28	Science & Technology	PT1H3M21S	201	2d	sd	false			193	1	0	0	0

Zendrive built state-of-the-art technologies on its huge cache of driving data from smartphones and OBD, to add a significant dimension to the route mapping of Google, that is safety risk of the route. Essentially the technology is built on millions of drivers zipping through the route or segments thereof. Automobile Insurance expands in UBI- where it has been established that tracking a driver’s behavior behind the wheels (like Hard Brake, Speeding etc) can predict significant differences between their chances of collisions. Looking at the same event data from the road perspective, aggregating the relative event density on road stretches also predict the relative chances of collision on that segment. We have used map matching using GIS techniques, parametric density estimation and rare event modeling using quasi-Poisson GLM to analyze our data, build the models and finally implement the scoring system across the GIS route maps. Key learnings : Relation between dangerous driving events and collisions Route risk as an aggregate of all the drivers (or sample thereof) and their driving risk. The route you take for commute may determine your auto insurance. Outline : Usage Based Insurance : relation between collision rates and dangerous driving. Driving events : aggressive acceleration, hard brake, speeding, phone use, aggressive turns Poisson GLM modeling to predict collision rates using driving data Events on a road segment : map-matching using GIS techniques to split trips along road stretches, and aggregate such events along the spatio-temporal dimension across all drivers. Route risk of the road segment and any route comprising such segments. Driving risk along such routes and corresponding collision risks using transfer of the GLM model. Assignment of risks to drivers on their daily route of commute, to be used in UBI.	28	Science & Technology	PT37M23S	2243	2d	sd	false			141	3	0	0	0

Examination malpractices remain a bother in the educational system. With so much of strictness being introduced inside the examination halls, which includes preventing the examinees to carry their own materials, putting students under active surveillance by multiple invigilators and even fixing CCTV cameras inside the examination halls, we are going to discuss what is the next thing we are likely to see in this practice. In this workshop, we will discuss a way to create a virtual examination supervision system that will be able to check the examinees throughout the period of the examination. Computers would be trained to detect ‘inappropriate’ motions of the candidates during an examination. We will talk about the algorithm introduced by Viola and Jones - ‘Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Feature’, which is the foundation of the setup we have designed. The discussion will further include our journey and the critical challenges faced towards this first step in creating a robust virtual examination surveillance system. This is a capstone project done by students of PGP in Data Science at Praxis Business School. The workshop would be delivered by the students and their faculty guide.	28	Science & Technology	PT59M38S	3578	2d	sd	false			739	25	0	0	5

Often, the in-store marketing campaign suffers from poor execution and damage within the store which in-turn leads to poor ROI for manufacturers. Auditing the deployment of marketing materials is plagued by inaccuracy and lengthy turnaround times due to the extensive use of manual methods to audit these stores. Further, verification of the findings of these audits is a difficult and time-consuming process for manufacturers. Our proposed solution aims to increase the accuracy, while simultaneously reducing the turnaround times for these in-store audits by applying the latest in computer vision to make these audits objective and speedy. By using an advanced CNN architecture like Google’s InceptionNet, we train a neural network to detect brands and eventually different types of in-store displays. The output of the neural networks is used to automatically tag and score images from audits. Automating the process will also make the verification of these audits quick and easy for clients. This would save them critical time and arm them with timely information to react quickly to new developments in the market.	28	Science & Technology	PT47M6S	2826	2d	sd	false			350	2	0	0	0

Today we spend more time behind the wheels then we would have a few years back. In Cities like Banglore where the roads are shrinking and number of vehicles increasing exponentially the situation is even worse. We already convey distance in terms of time rather than Kms. On an average, a person spends 3-4 hours a day behind the wheel. While we all are struggling to claim our share of the downtrodden roads we fight with a variety of stakeholders ranging from stray cows to speeding Taxi drivers. While in a different world with the technology progressing there are people working on the development of autonomous vehicles.	28	Science & Technology	PT3M32S	212	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2zjNoW0rQZE/maxresdefault.jpg		4499	50	0	0	2

Qubole’s Presto-as-a-Service is primarily intended for Data Analysts who need to translate business questions into SQL queries. Since the questions are often ad-hoc, there is some trial and error involved; arriving at the final results may involve a series of SQL queries. By reducing the response time of these queries, the platform can reduce the time to insight and greatly benefit the business. Besides performance efficiencies, users benefit substantially from multiple supported data formats, continuous auto-scaling and efficient management of Presto clusters, improved user experience, and tightened security. In this webinar, we will cover the following agenda. Presto-as-a-Service, on Qubole How Qubole Presto is different from OSS Presto How Qubole Presto is different from EMR Presto, Athena Demo on: Join Reorder, DF S3 Optimization Auto Scaling Spot Support Customer Use Cases Q&A Speaker Name: Shubham Tagra Designation: Software Engineer, Qubole Brief Profile/Bio: Shubham Tagra is a member of the technical staff at Qubole working on Presto and Hive development and making these solutions cloud ready. Previously, Shubham worked at NetApp on its storage area network. Shubham holds a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering from the National Institue of Technology, Karnataka, India.

From oil and gas, insurance and finance through to healthcare, defence and construction, @RISK and the other tools in the DecisionTools Suite enhance the decision-making capabilities of some of the world’s most successful companies. Palisade’s flagship software, @RISK, is used for Quantitative Risk Analysis using Monte Carlo simulation on models you make in Excel. Having been around since 1984, @RISK is used by more than 95% of Fortune 100 and 76% of Fortune 500 companies. Through a live demo of @RISK, we will try to demonstrate how easy – and necessary – it is to implement quantitative risk analysis in any business. We will also review some of the other quantitative techniques available in the DecisionTools Suite such as Optimisation with Evolver and RiskOptimizer, Predictive Analytics using NeuralTools, Data Visualisation with BigPicture and more. If you build models in Excel then Palisade solutions can almost certainly help you to make more informed decisions, right from your desktop. ----------------------------------------------------- Get in touch with us: Website: www.analyticsindiamag.com Contact: info@analyticsindiamag.com Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AnalyticsIndiaMagazine/ Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/analyticsindiam Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10283931/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/analyticsindiamagazine/	28	Science & Technology	PT25M34S	1534	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qNFGls0EE4Q/maxresdefault.jpg		144	1	0	0	0

It has a deep impact on multiple verticals including games, in particular, AlphaGo, Robotics, Natural Language Processing, Machine Translation, and Text Generation, Computer Vision, Business Management, Finance, Healthcare and Intelligent Transportation Systems. Magically, in some cases such as complex games (Go), its performance is way better than humans, while in other cases such as self-driven cars, it can work using video feeds to make complex driving decisions. In this talk, we will look at the advances in AI techniques, that led to the development of Deep Reinforcement Learning. Applications of DRL to games, Robotics and finance will be presented as well. There are a lot of challenges ahead for DRL. Although DRL has already been combined with AI techniques, such as search and planning, a deeper integration with other traditional AI approaches promises benefits such as better sample complexity, generalisation and interpretability.

It has a deep impact on multiple verticals including games, in particular, AlphaGo, Robotics, Natural Language Processing, Machine Translation, and Text Generation, Computer Vision, Business Management, Finance, Healthcare and Intelligent Transportation Systems. Magically, in some cases such as complex games (Go), its performance is way better than humans, while in other cases such as self-driven cars, it can work using video feeds to make complex driving decisions. In this talk, we will look at the advances in AI techniques, that led to the development of Deep Reinforcement Learning. Applications of DRL to games, Robotics and finance will be presented as well. There are a lot of challenges ahead for DRL. Although DRL has already been combined with AI techniques, such as search and planning, a deeper integration with other traditional AI approaches promises benefits such as better sample complexity, generalisation and interpretability. A lot of progress needs to happen to realize the greater goal of general-purpose AI systems (AGI) that can interact with and learn from the world around them. ----------------------------------------------------- Get in touch with us: Website: www.analyticsindiamag.com Contact: info@analyticsindiamag.com Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AnalyticsIndiaMagazine/ Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/analyticsindiam Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10283931/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/analyticsindiamagazine/	28	Science & Technology	PT26M26S	1586	2d	sd	false			250	0	0	0	0

It has become widely accessible and is an important avenue for businesses to find creative solutions for problems. The major challenge with data though is how to use it effectively and innovatively. Lending to lower-income households and small and informal enterprises is one such challenge that not many businesses have ventured into. Many of the people from this background have limited (if at all) access to formal financial services and this not only inhibits their ability to make good decisions on the responsible and appropriate use of credit but also limits their awareness about financial services. Tala has solved this problem by using the data from mobile phones to evaluate and score applicants’ creditworthiness and capacity. By doing so, it has not only made formal financial services accessible to the population that does not have access to it but has also empowered them and given them new hope for their future. ----------------------------------------------------- Get in touch with us: Website: www.analyticsindiamag.com Contact: info@analyticsindiamag.com Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AnalyticsIndiaMagazine/ Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/analyticsindiam Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10283931/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/analyticsindiamagazine/	28	Science & Technology	PT26M48S	1608	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZmQ1x3w91v0/maxresdefault.jpg		907	11	0	0	0

Forensic data analytics is an innovative fraud detection solution that enables the detection of fraudulent activity, non-standard or unethical behaviour and corrupt practices. Through the application of data analytic techniques and a detailed understanding of fraud and corruption, Control Risks is able to provide in-depth insights into a client’s relevant risks based on transactional data. Typical organisations lose 5% of revenue each year to fraud, with global fraud estimated to be approximately USD3.7 trillion dollars.It is assessed that by 2020, global fraud loses will likely exceed USD4.9 trillion dollars. The ongoing growth of social media is not only increasing fraud occurrences through data theft, identity takeover and opportunities for collusion, but is also exponentially increasing the reputational damage to companies caused by a large scale fraud. This indicates that typical corporations face a risk of fraud, no matter what size, country or sector they operate in. While fraud losses are significant at present, they are predicted to increase in the five year outlook. In an environment where fraud losses are so high, prevention is the most efficient and effective fraud risk management tool. Monitoring with data analytics : Despite the heightened external fraud risk environment, regular fraud monitoring for conflicts of interest, non-standard behaviour and fraudulent activity can significantly reduce a company’s fraud risk exposure and prevent damaging fraud losses. Control Risks specialises in bespoke, proactive fraud monitoring solutions that leverage data analytic capabilities to provide clients with a customizable approach to fraud detection. ----------------------------------------------------- Get in touch with us: Website: www.analyticsindiamag.com Contact: info@analyticsindiamag.com Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AnalyticsIndiaMagazine/ Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/analyticsindiam Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10283931/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/analyticsindiamagazine/	28	Science & Technology	PT26M47S	1607	2d	sd	false			127	1	0	0	0

Here's 1st of the 3 part of this original Web series by Analytics India Magazine. Vishesh, a self made master of marketing with more than five years of expertise, finds himself struggling to understand when and how data science became the most powerful deciding factor for business. The problem starts when Vishesh’s flatmate and co-employee, Kartik, gets fired for being a novice, which in today’s world means ‘not a data scientist’. This incident rings bells of panic in Vishesh’s head. But Vishesh, being a clever folk with all his intutional powers, was sure he can come out clean under these testing times.

The audience can look forward to an engrossing session on the developments in this space and to relevantly apply them in business use. Business leaders and analytics teams are looking to derive meaningful actionables from the business data, on the go. Just having MIS/BI reports or only visualizations will not help the cause – what is needed is an ability to get data-driven insights which can help them get the pulse of the business and suggest meaningful action points. Data driven insights are the fuel for every business decision being taken. Rather than relying on an analyst to get insights, business users can get insights directly from Robo-data-scientists using AI and machine learning. ----------------------------------------------------- Get in touch with us: Website: www.analyticsindiamag.com Contact: info@analyticsindiamag.com Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AnalyticsIndiaMagazine/ Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/analyticsindiam Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10283931/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/analyticsindiamagazine/	28	Science & Technology	PT22M26S	1346	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LDUV5FzsRAc/maxresdefault.jpg		145	1	0	0	0

Enterprises are looking at Big Data implementations to emerge out as data wizards by leveraging both internal and external data in delivering actionable insights and successful business outcomes. Even though most of the enterprises try to kick start big data implementation with a proof of concept using open source technology, often initiatives get delayed considerably owing to inherent complexity of big data environment and technologies associated. Enterprise-wide use cases require acquiring and processing large volumes and variety of data from various data sources.

This realisation is what has struck Vishesh, the protagonist of ‘The Dating Scientist’. No, he is not actually a hunter (in traditional sense). He is a corporate employee, who happens to have solid marketing skills. But his unique marketing brain is on the verge of becoming useless, thanks to the newly emerging field of data science. Such is the aura of data science among urban employees nowadays, that each of them is thinking in his head – “May be data science is the new sexy”, and Vishesh is no exception.

The unique power of digital in connecting advertisers with consumers has meant that a consumer can interact with a brand at any given time.

One form of complexity stems from the tendency of interdependencies to different modelling techniques like prediction and optimization. Prediction is not independent of optimization. Data scientists face a lot of difficulties in integrating different analytical solutions with business. Since, today’s business is changing very fast and is dynamic in nature, data scientists need to be careful about adjusting those states in their solution. The right coaching and approach towards business cases are very critical. Companies need resources with good analytics quotient and business knowledge who can appreciate the interdependencies of analytical solutions development.	28	Science & Technology	PT25M27S	1527	2d	sd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6ivU0K-jukM/maxresdefault.jpg		362	3	0	0	0

Here in India, with the economic landscape fast changing, organizations are searching for innovative ways to disrupt their industry and the most effective secret weapon used is data. Charting the path to transforming a company, especially a mature one can be long and arduous. How do you ensure that the output will be relevant in our dynamic industry? How long will it take and when can your data science or analytics team start delivering actionable insight? How can you overcome the challenges specific to the Indian context such as disorganized data sources? In this session, we’ll answer these questions and more as we discuss different ways of strategizing the transformation, challenges faced along the journey as well as challenges from an Indian context and how to circumvent them.	28	Science & Technology	PT26M30S	1590	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hviKhLSYDMg/maxresdefault.jpg		111	1	0	0	0

If you are still outsourcing analytics, you are missing out on the complete picture of your business. External vendors are not the answer since they can easily miss out on business priorities or insights that only your team would be able to appreciate. But that said, your team needs the right skills to extract value from massive sets of data. To do this, you need to nurture them with the right training. Unfortunately, the majority of corporate trainings that happen worldwide, especially in Asia, are still delivered in-person and instructor-led. JoAnn Ponce will discuss the problems associated with how corporate training is currently delivered. We will also look at innovative trends in education that make corporate training more effective, standardized across employees, easier to assess and track, scalable, and more cost-effective.	28	Science & Technology	PT26M25S	1585	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F37NnbFWyxI/maxresdefault.jpg		36	0	0	0	0

Weather. Commerce. Consumers. Analytics. On the surface, these seem to be loosely-tied topics, but they all come together as part of the next generation of predictive analytics that we are developing at The Weather Company, an IBM Business. What drives The Weather Company is a desire to better understand patterns and influences related to consumer behavior. Starting with location, understanding where people go and why they go there, that is the foundation. The Weather Company’s rich location based data derived from mobile users is the starting point. Then layer in weather and other external influences – how do these events drive people to move from place to place? How do they influence purchasing patterns? Telling a story about customers starts to become possible when disparate data sets are combined and analyzed, and new insights can be discovered. Ultimately, understanding how consumers act and what they purchase is of great value not only to businesses, but also for laying the foundation for examining topics related to developing IoT infrastructure.	28	Science & Technology	PT16M17S	977	2d	sd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mRcx5vYtzBI/maxresdefault.jpg		86	1	0	0	0

Part I	PANEL CHAIR: Geetika Goel, CTO at Jigsaw Academy PANELIST: Srinivas Padmanabhuni, Co-founder at Tarah Technologies PANELIST: Kavitha Mohammad, Director, Industrial Solutions Group at Intel Corporation PANELIST: Raghavan Kirthivasan, Sr Manager at AIG Science PANELIST Sanjay Srivastava: Director – Analytics at a fortune 500 company IoT is the latest buzzword around industry today. Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction (ref.:http://internetofthingsagenda.techtar...). This transfer of data is almost always large in volumes. A need is thus generated to be able to analyze this data and draw valuable insights from it. Data scientists seem perfect for this job. So, does it mean that a data scientist is naturally better suited for IoT jobs? Or is the data scientist just one of the agents within the large ecosystem of IoT products? Conversely, will IoT be the next ruse for all data scientists? Let us talk to our esteemed panelists and hear their views.	28	Science & Technology	PT7M19S	439	2d	sd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2g8WF7CD2vM/maxresdefault.jpg		191	0	0	0	1

At the same time the preponderance of multiple tools, techniques and knowledge base along with the fast changing nature of technology in data science creates an issue for analytics leaders and HR while hiring for their data science team. On top of this, given the high demand for people the attrition rates in the industry are high. This has led to a situation where employers end up spending months and large amount of money trying to hire people for their team and who may eventually not last for a long time in the organization.

Next Generation DATAWAREHOUSE that supports BIG DATA and includes support for both older and modern ‘self-service, cloud BI and Analytics tools’ Recent developments in BIG DATA have vastly improved the scope and depth of analytics that are possible by factoring in all available data. BIG DATA Engineering has given us many tools and techniques to store, process and access data. But, integrating the big-data pipelines into a datawarehouse that drives comprehensive queries and analysis that the modern BI and Analytics needs and expects is still an open problem. Current BI Datawarehouse falls short in handling this critical requirement of the new data driven world. SMART BIG DATA LAKE (SBDL) is a robust architectural and smart-data technology that allows universal schema-on-read access of all data. Deeper problems such as integrating out-of-order ETL processes some of which include more advanced Machine Learning, Un-structured-data, streaming-data and Graph processing pipelines can be handled in a scalable fashion with smart-big-data lakes. SBDL simultaneously supports comprehensive queries by modern self-service BI and Analytics tools on the cloud or on premise extending the benefits of BIG DATA to the frontlines.	28	Science & Technology	PT37M32S	2252	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lpq_BfipMY4/maxresdefault.jpg		889	9	0	0	0

Is there a lack of faith and if so what is causing it? Is it that they cannot find the right skills and tools and service providers? Is it that it’s just too confusing and intimidating a landscape? Or even that the internal culture issues are too daunting to overcome.

We hear there are a few hundred analytics firms in the country, but very few of them choose to play in the Indian market because – and this is the general view – it’s frankly impossible to build a viable analytics business doing work for domestic firm. Sure. But there’s more to this market than lower gross margins, and as the founder of one of the few players that have firmly planted a flag in the domestic market, Sandeep has plenty to share on what makes this market different, challenging, mind boggling, and, ultimately, rewarding.	28	Science & Technology	PT26M27S	1587	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DtLDsE4bNfI/maxresdefault.jpg		1023	8	0	0	0

That’s a question that crosses the mind of many people. The reason being that the real measure of any technology is the business outcomes it can have. In that context, many organisations start on the journey of Big Data but really hit the stumbling block in the business outcomes it can have. A lot of it to do with having the right data architectures, right use cases and the right kind of user mapping to the different layers of the data architecture. If done correctly, Big Data ceases to be a hype and starts delivering real business outcomes.

Dearth of analytics talent, unavailability of quality data, little knowledge of analytics, reliance on IT are some key challenges faced by the industry.

Sitting in office you know exactly what is there in your refrigerator, your watch reads your vitals and tells your doctor how you are doing without you getting involved, or even tracking down your lost keys! Ladies and Gentlemen, step ahead from the today’s advanced “smart thermostats”, to tomorrow’s advanced world where as you enter a cool home because your car instructs you air conditioner when to cool it for you as you drive back. Imagine a world where everything is connected, energy is efficiently used and it’s all driven by knowledge gained through analytics. It is expected that by 2020, we will have 50 billion devices connected to the internet as compared to today’s 15 billion. With the amount of data that will thus get generated, a successful marriage of Internet of Things with Big Data is surely on the cards giving a plethora of opportunities for enterprises to transform the way we live. This is what the workshop on “Internet of Things” will talk about – its origin, the status today, the expectations from it tomorrow and many more such things. www.analyticsindiasummit.com	27	Education	PT54M42S	3282	2d	sd	false			1118	8	1	0	0

There is great amount of noise that data is the center of any organization. However, in all the noise, we tend to miss the most important point. Data is not the center of any organization, it is the value that these data give, has to be the center of an organization. Data has to be an enabler for business and not the other way round. So, for an organization embarking on a big data journey, it’s very important to keep checkpoints on what are the business values the data is giving to them or has the Big Data journey stopped at just creating a huge storage system. And in that regard it’s very important to have the right tools which can help the different stakeholders within an organization to derive value out of the data. www.analyticsindiasummit.com	27	Education	PT42M4S	2524	2d	sd	false			182	4	0	0	0

The speed of innovation is high and varied; and at times confounding even seasoned data scientists.

In Analytic Sapiens, Atul Jalan ponders the edges of the otherwise. Can analytics and other technologies combine to help us discover our greatest strength as humans? Can analytics create a happiness industry more rooted in science? Were our ancient astrologers the first proponents of pattern recognition? Analytics could well be the next filter in our evolution – a move closer to the truly aware, truly sapient human. www.analyticsindiamag.com	27	Education	PT37M56S	2276	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t9-1OkZhy30/maxresdefault.jpg		167	0	0	0	0

This offers a unique opportunity – the ability to use this information to intelligently guide us. It also poses a challenge: how does one understand such vast quantities of data – which are well beyond most supercomputers’ comprehension, let alone the human mind? Yet, analytics and visualisation research has made great strides. With modern visualisations such as treemaps, over 150 pages of productivity reports have been compressed into a single sheet without loss of information or insight. With animated visualisations, 100 years of weather data has been compressed into half a minute video. A confluence of programming, statistics and design gives us new ways to visualise, experience, and interact with a world of information. This talk will cover – How organisations use visuals to comprehend large scale data – What kind of decisions can be driven through data, and how to enable this – How to monetise the data that’s already in your hands – What techniques and support mechanisms are available in the market today www.analyticsindiasummit.com	27	Education	PT57M46S	3466	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cXTHqIkuWmg/maxresdefault.jpg		478	3	0	0	1

It is very unlikely that you would find him not working on something new. His secret sauce however, is imagination coupled with the ability to crank, accelerate and build momentum. As CEO of Manthan, Atul’s single objective is to keep the spirit of invention and innovation alive at Manthan – a spirit that has seen Manthan go on to become one of the leading contenders in analytics business solutions for consumer industries worldwide. Manthan is Atul’s fourth successful venture after MicroTrack, Cybertrek and Net Kraft. And today, is among the few Indian companies that can boast an analytics portfolio that several Fortune 500 companies rely on. Atul is a known voice on technology and is sought for his views on analytics and the consumerization of technology by publications and forums worldwide. What is not known though, is that he also dabbles in poetry and takes keen interest in a wide range of subjects from music to astronomy. Loquacious and a polymath, Atul can hold forth the camera obscura and Johannes Vermeer as he can on analytics. Three-dimensional printing and the uber-personalized era it will drive us into, is his current obsession. And if his maverick, entrepreneurial nature is anything to go by, this could translate into something new. And the bigger and more beautiful it sounds, the more passionate he is likely to be about it.	22	People & Blogs	PT6M17S	377	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7acTyjoRy3g/maxresdefault.jpg		152	1	0	0	0

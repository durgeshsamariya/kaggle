Get Office 365 - https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/Vk9OR Note that this function is only available in Office 365 (Home, Personal and University edition) at the time of recording this video. It will likely be made available to all Office 365 users. Download the Example file: http://bit.ly/2tyQw7I The following XLOOKUP examples are covered in this video: 1. SIMPLE LOOKUP (Lookup and fetch a value): In this example, I will show you how to use XLOOKUP to look for value and fetch it. It can fetch the value from the right or the left of the lookup value (something VLOOKUP isn't made to it) 2. LOOKUP AND FETCH THE ENTIRE RECORD: XLOOKUP can be used to look for value and fetch the entire record (entire row or column) from the return_array 3. TWO WAY LOOKUP: You can use two XLOOKUP functions together to get the two-way lookup (i.e, look for a value that meets two lookup criteria) 4. ERROR HANDLING IN XLOOKUP: Error handling in in-built in XLOOKUP and there is a dedicated argument where you can specify what you want in case there is an error. This could be a value, a cell reference or another formula. This a major improvement over using the VLOOKUP and IFERROR combination in the past 5. NESTED XLOOKUP: You can nest multiple XLOOKUP functions together to do a multi-level lookup. For example, you can look through multiple tables (in the same or separate worksheet) and fetch the value. 6. FIND THE LAST MATCHING VALUE: Again something that has been baked into XLOOKUP. You can choose the direction of the lookup. So you can fetch the first matching value or the last matching value 7. APPROXIMATE MATCH: There is also the approximate match where you can choose where you want the values just smaller/larger than the lookup value 8. HORIZONTAL LOOKUP: With XLOOKUP, you can do vertical lookup as well as horizontal lookup 9. CONDITIONAL LOOKUP: You can combine XLOOKUP with other formulas to do a conditional lookup. For example, if you want to look up what person has the maximum salary, you can do that easily using XLOOKUP with MAX. 10. WILDCARD LOOKUP: XLOOKUP can handle wildcard characters, but you need to specify that you will be using these. This example shows how to can do a partial lookup with wildcards.

You can do this using the custom number formatting where you can specify the format to show values in thousands (or millions) and also add the word "Thousand" or "K" to it. The best part about this method is that it only changes how your data looks in Excel and has no impact on the value within the cell. So you can still use the cell in calculations.

The following methods of transposing data are covered in this video: -- Transpose using Paste Special -- Using the TRANSPOSE function -- Transpose using Find and Replace and Paste Special When you use Paste Special to transpose the data, it will give you the static result. This means that when you change the original dataset, it will not update the resulting transposed data. If you want to have the transposed data linked, you need to use the Transpose function or the Find and Replace technique I cover in the video. One issue that I don't like about the TRANSPOSE function is that you need to select the range which is of the same size as the expected result.

When you add a 0 before a number in Excel, it would automatically be removed. For example, if you enter 010, Excel would remove the 0 and make it 10. This may be needed if you have data such as zip codes or employee ids and you want to make all these of consistent length. You can use Custom Number formatting to specify how long you want a number to be. For example, if you want all the numbers to ve five-digit long, you can make the custom format as 00000 This will make sure that your numbers are at least five-digit long.

There are different ways you can manipulate text data in Excel. And one of the common things people do in Excel is to manage the names datasets. Here are the methods covered in this video to split names into first and last names: -- Text to Columns -- Find and Replace -- Flash Fill -- Formulas All these methods work great and are quick and easy. With the first three methods, the result you get is static. This means that if your names data changes, then the resulting data wouldn't change. The last method in this video shows how to split names using formulas. With formulas, you get a result that is dynamic. This means that if you change the original dataset, the resulting data automatically updates. Text to Columns method uses a delimiter to separate the first and last name. The delimited could be a space character or any other delimiter - such as a comma. Find and Replace method uses wildcard characters to find and replace part of the name. For example, if you want to remove the last name and only keep the first name, you can do that with Find and Replace. Flash Fill is one of the easiest methods to split names in Excel. All you have to do si type in a few cells and it automatically identifies a pattern and gives you the same result for all the cells. Note that Flash Fill is available only in Excel 2013 and later versions.

In Excel, you can hide multiple worksheets at one go but you can not unhide multiple sheets at one go. If you use the inbuilt functionality to unhide sheets, it will only unhide one sheet at a time. However, there are a couple of methods you can use to unhide all sheets at one go in Excel. This video covers the following methods to unhide sheets: -- Manually Unhide one sheet at a time -- Unhide all sheets using VBA code in the immediate window -- Unhide all sheets by using a VBA macro code and adding it to the quick access toolbar -- Unhide sheets using custom view option. With VBA immediate window, you can quickly run a line of code by simply adding it in the immediate window and hitting the enter key. Below is the line of code to use in the immediate window in the VB Editor: For each Sheet in Thisworkbook.Sheets: Sheet.Visible=True: Next Sheet As soon as you hit the enter key (after placing the cursor at the end of the line), it will instantly unhide all the hidden sheets. The good thing about this is that you don't need to save the Excel workbook as a macro-enabled workbook. Another method is by saving a VBA macro code to unhide sheets in the personal macro workbook and then adding that code to the Quick Access Toolbar (QAT) Doing this would allow you to work on any workbook and instantly unhide sheets with a click of a button. Below is the VBA code to save in the personal macro workbook: Sub UnhideAllSheets() For Each Sheet In Sheets Sheet.Visible = True Next Sheet End Sub The third method to unhide sheets is by using custom views. You can save a custom view when all the sheets are visible and then when you have to unhide all the worksheets, you can go back to that view. This method to unhide sheets is not suited in all situations but can be useful if you're using custom views anyway.

I will also cover how to delete every third/fourth/fifth row or column in Excel. To delete alternate rows, you can use a helper column and use a formula that helps you identify alternate rows. This could be done by using the ISEVEN function that checks each row number and returns TRUE if the row is even and false if it isn't. Once you have this, you can easily filter the rows with FALSE in the helper columns and delete these. In case you want to delete every third row, you need to use the MOD function to identify every third row. Once you have it, you can easily filter and delete every third row or every fourth row. I also cover a method to use a simple VBA code to delete alternate rows in Excel. Below is that VBA CODE TO DELETE ALTERNATE ROWS: Sub Delete_Every_Other_Row() Dim Rng As Range Set Rng = Application.InputBox("Select the Range (Excluding headers)", "Range Selection", Type:=8) For i = Rng.Rows.Count To 1 Step -2 If i Mod 2 = 0 Then Rng.Rows(i).Delete End If Next i End Sub When it comes to deleting alternate columns, you can not filter these. But you can sort and bring all those columns together that you want to delete. I cover a simple method that uses the MOD function to identify alternate columns and then sort these from left-to-right to bring these together. Once you have these in one place, you can select and delete these. And there is also a VBA code that you can use to delete alternate columns. Below is the VBA CODE TO DELETE ALTERNATE COLUMNS Sub Delete_Every_Other_Column() Dim Rng As Range Set Rng = Application.InputBox("Select the Range (Excluding headers)", "Range Selection", Type:=8) For i = Rng.Columns.Count To 1 Step -2 If i Mod 2 = 0 Then Rng.Columns(i).Delete End If Next i End Sub You can also read more about this method here: https://trumpexcel.com/delete-every-other-row-excel/ Free Excel Course - https://trumpexcel.com/learn-excel/ Paid Online Training - https://trumpexcel.com/excel-training/ Best Excel Books: https://trumpexcel.com/best-excel-books/ ⚙️ Gear I Recommend: Camera - https://amzn.to/3bmHko7 Screen Recorder - techsmith.z6rjha.net/26D9Q USB Mic - https://amzn.to/2uzhVHd Wireless Mic: https://amzn.to/3blQ8uk Lighting - https://amzn.to/2uxOxRv Subscribe to get awesome Excel Tips every week: https://www.youtube.com/user/trumpexcel?sub_confirmation=1 Note: Some of these links here are affiliate links! #Excel #ExcelTips #ExcelTutorial	27	Education	PT9M53S	593	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W2Tvxp851Lg/maxresdefault.jpg	1	8505	122	2	0	14

The video also covers a method to remove zero values in Excel. There are multiple ways you can hide zero values in Excel: -- Using an in-built functionality that hides all the zeros in the cells in the selected worksheets -- Using conditional formatting to change the font color of the cells that have 0 in it -- Using conditional formatting to apply a custom format that hides zero values -- Using a custom format that specifies blank as the format for cells that have 0 in it And in case you don't want to hide the zeroes but instead remove these, you can use Find and Replace. With Find and Replace, you can instantly find and select all the cells that have 0 in it. Once you have these selected, you can either remove these or format it or enter any specific text in it. NOTE: When you hide a zero value in Excel, it only hides the value from being visible. It still remains a part of the cell and in case you use this cell in any calculation, the zero value will be used.

The trick is to use Conditional formatting with a formula that checks each cell for the row number and returns a TRUE for every second row and FALSE otherwise. This TRUE/FALSE result is then used by Conditional Formatting to apply the specified formatting. In this video, I use the MOD function to check the row number (which is given by the ROW function). The formula used is =MOD(ROW(),2)=1 The above formula takes the ROW function result and divides it by 2 and returns the remainder. The possible result of the MOD function in this can be a 0 or a 1 (0 if the row number is even and 1 when it's odd). It then checks whether the value is equal to 1 or not. Since the data starts from second row onwards, I am checking for 1. else I would have checked for 0. This formula then returns a TRUE when the ROW number is either 3 or 5 or 7 or so on, and FALSE when it's even. Conditional formatting then uses this to shade/color every second row in the dataset. In case you want to highlight/color every third row, you change the formula to =MOD(ROW(),3)=1 This would highlight every third row instead. Another quick way to highlight alternate rows in Excel is to convert the data into an Excel Table. An Excel Table automatically colors alternate rows.

The following methods of inserting a checkmark symbol in Excel are covered in this video: 1) Copy and Paste the Check Mark (✓) 2) Use the Keyboard Shortcuts 3) Using the Symbols Dialog Box 4) Using the CHAR Formula 5) Using Autocorrect 6) Using Conditional Formatting to Insert Check Mark 7) Using a Double-Click (uses VBA) A checkmark symbol is different than a checkbox. While a checkbox is an object that floats over the worksheet, a checkmark is a part of the cell and is entered just like you enter the text. This means that you can format the checkmark by changing its size, color, or font type. The easiest way to insert a checkmark in Excel is to simply copy it and paste it. Although this is a manual process, it can be great when you only want a few of these checkmarks/tick marks. Below is a checkmark (tick mark) symbol and you can copy and paste in Excel: ✓ You also have keyboard shortcuts in Excel that you can use to insert a checkmark directly into the cell. Note that these keyboard shortcuts will work only when you change the cell formatting to Wingdings or Wingdings 2. You can also use the CHAR formula to get the checkmark symbol in Excel. This function uses the ANSI code of the checkmark symbol and gives you the corresponding character, For this to work, you need to change the cell formatting to Wingdings. The good thing about using a formula is that it allows you to get the result based on the cell value. For example, you can get the checkmark if the cell value crosses the 200-mark (example covered in the video). Autocorrect is another way to insert a checkmark symbol by adding an autocorrect text. For example, you can create a system where as soon as you enter 'cmark' and hit the space key, it would automatically convert the 'cmark' to a checkmark. The exact process is covered in the video. Conditional Formatting is another method covered in the video. You can quickly get the checkmark (tick mark) or the cross mark based on the cell value. To do this, you need to apply conditional formatting icons to the cells that have the values. And the last method covered in this video is using VBA to automatically insert a checkmark as soon as you double-click on a cell. This works by adding a short VBA code in the Excel workbook. Once the code is copied, when you double click on any cell in the specified column, it would automatically insert the checkmark and when you double-click again, it would remove it. Below the VBA code that does this (exact steps to copy the code in the VB Editor is shown in the video): Private Sub Worksheet_BeforeDoubleClick(ByVal Target As Range, Cancel As Boolean) If Target.Column = 2 Then Cancel = True Target.Font.Name = "Wingdings" If Target.Value = "" Then Target.Value = "ü" Else Target.Value = "" End If End If End Sub Remember to save the workbook as an Excel macro-enabled workbook.

You don't need any VBA/Macros or coding or formulas to do this as this is an in-built functionality in Excel. All you need to do is open it and start with data entry. There are two things you need to do before starting to use the Data entry form in Excel: 1) Add the Data Entry form icon in the Quick Access Toolbar 2) Convert your Excel data into an Excel table. Once you have done this, you can simply click on the data entry form icon and it will open it. Now you can start using it. Data Entry form is amazing as it allows you to make the data entry process faster and makes it less error-prone. In this video about using Data entry form in Excel, I cover the following topics: -- Adding Data Entry form icon to the QAT -- Converting the Excel data into an Excel table -- Using Data Entry form to add a new record to your dataset -- Navigating the existing records using the form -- Finding all records that match specific criteria (such as before or after a specific date or matching a specific text value) -- Find partial matches using wild card characters -- Creating conditional data entry rules to ensure the right data is entered. Data Entry form makes it easy when you have a dataset that spans multiple columns. It also allows you to quickly navigate the records and correct/edit record if you want (right within the Data Entry Form). Some additional things to know about the data entry form in Excel: -- If you have a named range with the name ‘Database’, then the Excel Form will also refer to this named range, even if you have an Excel table. -- The field width in the Excel Data Entry form is dependent on the column width of the data. If your column width is too narrow, the same would be reflected in the form. -- You can also insert bullet points in the data entry form. To do this, use the keyboard shortcut ALT + 7 or ALT + 9 from your numeric keypad. Here is a video about bullet points. Note that an Excel Data Entry form is different than a VBA Userform. While you can easily customize a VBA Userform, It's not possible to customize the Data entry form. But in most cases, the in-built data entry form in Excel is good enough to do most of the data entry work that you may need in your day-to-day data entry job. You can read more about the Data entry form here: Free Excel Course - https://trumpexcel.com/learn-excel/ Paid Online Training - https://trumpexcel.com/excel-training/ Best Excel Books: https://trumpexcel.com/best-excel-books/ ⚙️ Gear I Recommend: Camera - https://amzn.to/3bmHko7 Screen Recorder - techsmith.z6rjha.net/26D9Q USB Mic - https://amzn.to/2uzhVHd Wireless Mic: https://amzn.to/3blQ8uk Lighting - https://amzn.to/2uxOxRv Subscribe to get awesome Excel Tips every week: https://www.youtube.com/user/trumpexcel?sub_confirmation=1 Note: Some of these links here are affiliate links! #Excel #ExcelTips #ExcelTutorial	27	Education	PT10M35S	635	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v2ntjP692VQ/maxresdefault.jpg	1	20200	341	5	0	32

Mostly we get datasets that are arranged in columns (with headers in a row). This is the top to a bottom format which most of us are used to. And when you sort this data, you sort it from top to bottom. But sometimes, you may have to work with data which is on rows (i.e., the headers are in a column). And if you want to sort this data, you will have to sort it from left to right (sort horizontally). In this video, I show two ways of sorting the data in Excel from left to right: 1. Using the inbuilt left to right sorting feature in Excel 2. By first copying and transposing the data, sorting it from top to bottom, and then copying and transposing it back again. While using the inbuilt left-to-right sort feature is more convenient, a lot of people prefer transposing it as they are used to top to bottom data format. I also cover how to create custom sorting criteria in Excel. For example, when you sort the data by region from left to right, you end up with - East, North, South, and West. This is because the data has been sorted alphabetically. But what if you want to sort it in the following order - East, West, North, South. To do this, you need to create a custom sorting criteria which you can then use to sort the data (left to right or top to bottom both).

The video covers the following topics: -- Introduction to Conditional Formatting -- Using Formula in Conditional Formatting -- Advanced Examples (Highlight Every Nth Row, Creating Dynamic Search) Conditional formatting is a great feature in Excel that allows you to highlight data points based on the specified conditions. It's loaded with features and you can use it to apply a background color to a cell based on the value in it. You can also change a lot of formatting (such as font type, font size, border, etc.) with conditional formatting. Apart from it, conditional formatting has a rich set of icons that you can use to make your data more visual. For example, you can use it to apply tick mark and cross mark or traffic lights icons based on the cell value. One of the most powerful aspects of conditional formatting is that you can use a custom formula to check cell value and apply formatting to it accordingly. For example, if you want to highlight all the rows where the sales value is less than 100, you can do this by using a custom formula in conditional formatting. There are many awesome things you can do with conditional formatting in Excel and this video covers a few examples of that.

Data validation allows you to make sure any data that is entered in a cell meets specified criteria (i.e, it's first validated and then allowed). For example, if you only want to make a cell accept date values, you can set that in data validation. Or if you only want to accept numbers up to 10 digits, you can specify that in Data Validation. Drop Down Lists are a part of data validation, as it gives the user an option to select from a pre-populated list. This can be really useful when you have a workbook where you want people to do data entry or when you're creating an Excel dashboard. The video covers all the basic data validation topics and then also covers some advanced data validation topic - such as dependent drop-down lists, input messages, dynamic drop-down lists. etc. It covers the following topics: -- Data Validation Criteria -- Input Message -- Customizing Error Messages -- Circle Invalid Entries -- Advanced Data Validation Tricks (such as Create Dependent Validation, Make Sub Headings in Validation, Disguise Numbers as Text, Creating Dynamic Drop Down List) ☕ If you're the videos useful and would like to support me, you can buy me a coffee - https://www.buymeacoffee.com/SumitB This video is a part of my Free Online Excel Training where I show you how to use Excel from the basics and also cover a lot of advanced topics.

Named Range - as the name suggests - is a range that has been named. This can be extremely useful as it allows you to use this defined name instead of the range. For example, instead of using A1:C10, you could instead use the name SaleData in the formula. This video will cover a brief introduction of the named range and then show you how to create one in Excel. It also covers some advanced concepts such as creating a dynamic named range - something that automatically updates in case your data changes. A very popular use of the dynamic named range is to create dependent drop-down lists (which is covered in detail in this video). You can use functions such as INDEX or OFFSET to create dynamic named ranges. This video also covers some important named range keyboard shortcuts that can help you save time. It covers the following topics: -- Creating Named Ranges -- Managing Named Ranges -- Important Keyboard Shortcuts -- Creating Dynamic Named Ranges using OFFSET and INDEX formulas ☕ If you're the videos useful and would like to support me, you can buy me a coffee - https://www.buymeacoffee.com/SumitB This video is a part of my Free Online Excel Training where I show you how to use Excel from the basics and also cover a lot of advanced topics.

To make sure this is dynamic, I have used a very simple VBA code as well (the worksheet change event). Useful Notes: -- This method would not impact any formatting/highlighting you have done manually to the cells. -- Conditional formatting is volatile. If you use it on very large datasets, it may lead to a slow workbook. -- The VBA code used above would refresh the workbook every time there is a change in selection. -- CELL Function is available in Excel 2007 and above version for Windows and Excel 2011 and above for Mac. In case you’re using an older version, use this technique by Chandoo.

While you can do that by using copy paste of VBA, it's an area where Power Query excels. With Power Query, you can easily (and quickly) combine data from tables in multiple sheets into one single table. The only pre-requisite is that the data should be in Excel tables or at least names ranges.

This means that you sort data by 2 or more columns. You can read more about it here: https://trumpexcel.com/multiple-level-sorting-excel/ When working with data in Excel, sorting the data is one of the common things you might have to do. In most of the cases, you need to sort a single column. But in some cases, there may be a need to sort two columns or more than two columns. There are two ways to do this - using the Sort dialog box and using the Sort icons. You can find these options in the Data tab in the Excel ribbon. In the Sort dialog box, you can specify the order of sorting. You can add a sorting level and then you can add more sorting levels below it. You can also use the sort icons, which needs to be used in the reverse order. So if you want to sort Column A and then Column B, you use sort icon on Column B first and then use it in Column A. It is recommended to use the Sort dialog box as it less confusing and allows you to sort based on other parameters as well - such as cell color, font color or cell Icon.

In this video, I will show you three ways to do this. Read More: https://trumpexcel.com/find-last-occurrence/ While the VLOOKUP function can find the first matching instance, what if you want to find the last instance of the lookup value. In that case, you need to use a combination of formulas. In this video I cover three methods - two of these methods use inbuilt excel functions, and the third one uses VBA to create a custom function. The first technique uses the fact that the last matching item would have the highest row number (among all the other matching values). It uses a formula to find that row and return its position. The second method uses the LOOKUP formula to do this. The third method uses a custom function. Below is the code that is used to create the function: 'This is a code for a function that finds the last occurrence of a lookup value and returns the corresponding value from the specified column 'Code created by Sumit Bansal (https://trumpexcel.com) Function LastItemLookup(Lookupvalue As String, LookupRange As Range, ColumnNumber As Integer) Dim i As Long For i = LookupRange.Columns(1).Cells.Count To 1 Step -1 If Lookupvalue = LookupRange.Cells(i, 1) Then LastItemLookup = LookupRange.Cells(i, ColumnNumber) Exit Function End If Next i End Function You can use any of the following methods to get this done.

In the first video, I shared how to do this when data is in Excel Tables and each table has the same name. In the second video, I covered how to combine data when there are no Excel Tables, but the sheet names are the same. But what if neither the sheet names nor the Excel tables are same. Then you need to use the Excel.Workbook function in Power Query to fetch the data, sort the object type, and then combine the sorted object types. In this video, I will show you exactly how to do this. Note – this technique will give you the combined data even when there is a mismatch in column names. For example, if in East.xlsx, you have a column that has been misspelled, you will end up 5 columns. Power Query will fill data in columns if it finds, and if it can not find a column, it will report the value as ‘null’. Similarly, if you have some additional columns in any of the tables worksheets, these will be included in the final result.

But what if the data is not in Excel Tables. In this video, I cover how to combine data from multiple workbooks, where the name of the worksheets is same. For example, if you have the worksheet named 'Data' in all the workbooks, then you can use Power Query to combine these. There are a few things you need to be cautious when it’s just tabular data and not an Excel Table. -- The worksheet names should be the same. This will help Power Query to go through your workbooks and combine the data in the from the worksheets that have the same name in each workbook. -- Power Query is case sensitive. This means a worksheet named ‘data’ and ‘Data’ are considered different. Similarly, a column with the header ‘Store’ and one with ‘store’ are considered different. -- While it’s important to have the same column headers, it’s not important to have the same order. If column 2 in the ‘East.xlsx’ is column 4 in ‘West.xlsx’, Power Query will match it correctly by mapping the headers.

For example, suppose you have the sales data for different regions (East, West, North, and South). You can combine this data from different workbooks into a single worksheet using Power Query. If you have these workbooks in different locations/folders, it’s a good idea to move all these into a single folder (or create a copy and put that workbook copy in the same folder). In this video, I will show you how to combine data from multiple workbooks in Excel, when the data is in an Excel Table, and the name of the table is same across all workbooks. A few things to know: -- If you select an Excel Table as the template/key, Power Query will use the column names in this Table to combine the data from other Tables. If other Tables have additional columns, those will be ignored. In case those other Tables don’t have a column, which is there in your Template Table, Power Query would just put ‘null’ for it. -- The columns don’t need to be in the same order as Power Query uses column headers to map columns. -- Since you have selected Table1 as the key, Power Query will look for Table1 in all the workbooks, and combine all these. In case it doesn’t find an Excel Table with the same name (Table1 in this example), Power Query will give you an error.

I had to select the first 500 cells at one go from each worksheet and copy it. I then had to paste this data into a tool I was using. Now doing this manually isn’t hard, but since I had multiple worksheets, I started thinking of a faster way to do this. In this video, I’ll show you two faster methods of doing this (with and without VBA). The first method is using the Name Box, where you can simply type the range reference in the Name Box and it will instantly select the specified cells or rows. For example, if you want to select first 100 cells in column A, you can enter A1:A100 in the Name Box. Another technique that I show in the video is using VBA. With VBA, you can write a single line code and then add it to the QAT (Quick Access Toolbar). When added, all you need to do it click the button and it will instantly select 500 cells or rows at one go (or any number of cells/rows that you specify).

If you're using Excel 2016, you already have Power Query options in the Data tab (under the Get & Transform group). If you're using Excel 2010 or 2013, you will need to download, install and activate Power Query. Note that Power Query and Get & Transform refer to the same thing. For Excel 2010/2013, you need to install the Power Query add-in to use it (steps described below). -- Click here to download the Power Query add-in. Make sure you are downloading 32-bit if your Excel is 32-bit and 64 bit if your Excel is 64 bit. -- Install the Power Query add-in. -- Open Excel. If you see a Power Query tab, skip the remaining steps. If not, move to the next step. -- Go to File and click on Options. -- In the ‘Excel Options’ dialog box, click on Add-in in the left pane. -- From the Manage drop-down, select COM Add-ins, and click on Go. -- In the list of available add-ins, select Power Query and click OK. -- Close the Excel Application and restart Excel.

For example, if you're a project manager involved in effort estimate, you can't have 12.7 full-time resources working on a project. You need to round this number to 13 (the nearest integer). Similarly, if you're buying stocks that are sold in a batch of 5, and you can afford a maximum of 123 shares only, you need to round it down to 120 (i.e., the nearest 5). While you can do this manually for a couple of values, doing it for hundreds of such value could become tedious and highly prone to errors. There are a couple of great functions in Excel that allows you to quickly round to the nearest integer or the nearest 0.5 or 5 or 10 value. In this video, I will show you how to use the MROUND, CEILING, and FLOOR functions to do this type of rounding in Excel.

You can specify the delimiter (such as a space, comma, or tab) and the Text to Columns functionality would use this delimiter to split the content of the cells. Examples of this include splitting first and last names, or username and domain name in email ids. However, if you have a dataset where the delimiter is a line break (in the same cell), it gets tricky to split these multiple lines in the same cell into separate cells/columns. In this video, I will show you how to make line break a delimiter in the Text to Columns functionality so that you can use line break to split the contents of a cell. Here are the steps: -- Select the entire dataset that you want to split. -- Go to the Data tab.Data -- In the Data Tools group, click on the Text to Columns option. -- In the Text to Columns dialog box, in Step 1 of 3, select Delimited and click ‘Next’. -- In Step 2 of 3, uncheck any existing Delimiters selection, and select the ‘Other’ option. Now Use the keyboard shortcut Control + J (hold the ‘Control’ key and then press the ‘J’ key). You will not see anything in the box except a tiny blinking dot (if you look hard). Also, you will see the expected result in the ‘Data preview’ section (as shown below). Click on Next. -- In Step 3 of 3, change the ‘Destination’ cell to the one where you want the output. -- Click on Finish.

In this video, I will show you three ways to filter cells with text in bold font formatting: -- Using Find and Replace -- Using Get.Cell function -- Using Custom Function made with VBA With Find and Replace, you can find all the cells that have a specific format in it. So you can specify the bold font format and Find and Replace will find all the cells with it. Now you can replace this format with one that colors the cells with the specified color. Once the cells have the background color, you can easily filter these using the Filter by Color option. GET.CELL is a Macro4 function. While you can not use it in the worksheet, you can still use it in named ranges in Excel. Once you create this named range, you can use it to get TRUE for all cells that have cells with text in bold font format. Now you can filter these cells and you will also have filtered the one with bold font format. The VBA custom function works the same way. The formula returns TRUE when the cell has text in bold font format and FALSE when it doesn't. Now you can filter the cell with TRUE.

You can hide a worksheet and the user would not see it when he/she opens the workbook. However, they can easily unhide the worksheet if they want (as we will see later in the video). But what if you don’t want them to be able to unhide the worksheet(s)? To do that, you need to take a couple of additional steps to make sure the worksheets are ‘very hidden’ (also covered later in this video). In this video, you will learn: -- Regular Way of Hiding a Worksheet in Excel -- How to Hide a Worksheet So That It Can Not be Unhidden -- How to Unhide a Sheet that has been ‘Very Hidden’ -- How to Hide/Unhide Worksheets Using VBA You can easily hide and unhide sheets in Excel by right-clicking on the tab and then using the hide/unhide option. But to hide in a way that it can not be easily unhidden, you need to go to the VB Editor and change the visible property of the worksheet to xlSheetVeryHidden. You can do this manually or use the VBA code covered in this tutorial.

A radio button allows the user to select an option which updates a dashboard or a report. It can also be used to create a survey where one answer per question can be selected. In this video, you will learn how to insert the radio button (option button) in Excel, how to create copies of it, and how to link it to a cell in Excel. Once a radio button is linked to a cell, whenever you make a selection, the linked cell updates to reflect the selection. This linked cell can then be used to update dashboards and reports/charts. The video also shows how to group radio buttons (option buttons) so that a group of radio buttons is independent of the other group. It also covers an example on how to update a simple column chart based on the radio button selection made by the user.

In this video, I will show you how to extract numbers from a text string in Excel (and vice-versa, extract text from a string in Excel). The video covers the following topics: -- Extract Numbers/Text from String in Excel (using TEXTJOIN) -- Extract Numbers from String in Excel (using VBA) -- Extract Text from a String in Excel (using VBA) You can use any of the methods covered to separate text and numbers in Excel. If you're using Excel 2016, you can use the new TEXTJOIN formula which makes it a lot easier to extract numbers from a string. The below formula extracts the numbers from a string in a cell in Excel: =TEXTJOIN("",TRUE,IFERROR((MID(A2,ROW(INDIRECT("1:"&LEN(A2))),1)*1),"")) But if you're not using Excel 2016 (and using prior versions such as Excel 2013/2010/2007/2003), you need to use a longer and more complicated formula (you can find that formula here: https://trumpexcel.com/extract-numbers-from-string-excel/ And in case you are fine using VBA, you can easily create a custom User Defined Formula that takes the cell reference as the input and extracts the number part from a string. It's easy and neat with VBA. Personally, I prefer using the VBA method to separate Numbers and Text in Excel as it only requires the work once and can be used over and over again.

Target Charts in Excel	If you work involves reporting the actual and target data, you may find it useful to present the actual values versus the target values in a chart in Excel. For example, you can show the actual sales values versus the target sales values, or the satisfaction rating achieved versus the target rating. There can be multiple ways to create a chart in Excel that shows the data with Actual Value and the Target Value. In this video, I will show you two methods to create Actual Vs. Target Charts in Excel. The first method uses only columns bars to show the difference by changing the width of the target and actual values. The second method uses markers to create a marker for the target value and the actual value is shown as the bar.

In case you work with charts that are frequently updated, it’s better to create a dynamic chart range. A dynamic chart range is a data range that updates automatically when you change the data source. This dynamic range is then used as the source data in a chart. As the data changes, the dynamic range updates instantly which leads to an update in the chart. In this video, I will show you two ways to create a dynamic chart range in Excel - using Excel Table and Using Excel formulas. In most of the cases, it is better to go with Excel Table as it is quite easy to create and manage. In case you are using versions prior to Excel 2007 (which don't have the Excel Table feature), or can't use Excel Table, then you can create dynamic named ranges and use these to create dynamic charts.

You can also use it when you're updating a file and need to keep a track of all the changes you do yourself. This can be helpful when you revisit it sometime later. In this video, I will show you how to track changes in Excel. The video first covers how to enable the track changes functionality in Excel. To do this: -- Go to the Review tab. -- In the Changes group, click on the Track Changes option and select Highlight Changes. -- In the Highlight Changes dialog box, check the option - 'Track changes while editing. This also shares your workbook'. You can also specify the 'When', 'Who', and 'Where' options. For this tutorial, I will go with the default settings (these options are explained later in the article). -- Click OK. The above steps would enable 'Track Changes' in Excel and now it will highlight any change done to the workbook. The video also covers: -- How to accept/reject changes. -- How to get a list of all the changes listed in a separate tab. -- How to disable track changes in Excel.

Excel formulas are easy to create and edit in Excel. You can easily edit a formula in a cell through the formula bar or directly in the cell. While this makes it convenient to create formulas in Excel, it comes with a few disadvantages as well. Consider this. You are going through a worksheet full of formulas and you accidentally hit the delete key, or backspace key, or some other number/alphabet key. Now you'll be lucky if you're able to spot the error and correct it. But if you don't. it may lead to some erroneous results. And let me tell you this, errors in Excel have cost millions to companies (read this or this). The chances of such errors increase multifold when you share a file with colleagues or managers or clients. One of the ways to prevent this to lock the worksheet, which in turn lock all the cells in the worksheet. However, doing this would prevent the user from making any changes to the worksheet. For example, if you're sending a workbook to your manager for review, you may want to allow him to add his comments or color code cells as his/her feedback. A better workaround to this is to lock cells that have formulas in Excel. In this video, you will learn how to lock cells that have formulas in it.

When you copy a cell that has a formula in it and pastes it somewhere else, it automatically adjusts the cell references. For example, suppose I have the formula =A1+A2 in cell B1. When I copy the cell B1 and paste it in B2, the formula automatically becomes =A2+A3. This happens as Excel automatically adjusts the references to make sure the rows and columns now refer to the adjusted rows and columns. Note: This adjustment happens when you’re using relative references or mixed references. In the case of absolute references, the exact formula gets copied. When using relative/mixed references in your formulas, you may – sometimes – want to copy and paste formulas in Excel without changing the cell references.

Excel VLOOKUP function, in its basic form, can look for one lookup cell/value and return the corresponding value from the specified row. But often there is a need to use VLOOKUP with multiple criteria/condition. For example, you may want to use VLOOKUP to find the matching value when the lookup values are in multiple cells. In this video, I will show you two techniques to use the VLOOKUP with Multiple Criteria -- Using helper columns and -- Using the CHOOSE Function. Both of these methods work well, but I prefer using the helper column method as it's easy and faster. The only downside of using a helper column for doing a multiple cell VLOOKUP is that you have to add an extra column (which is not the case with the CHOOSE array formulas method) So, instead of just using one cell as the lookup value, you can use Vlookup with multiple cells (i.e., use multiple cells as the criteria in VLOOKUP to fetch the corresponding value) Read More + Download File: https://trumpexcel.com/vlookup-with-multiple-criteria/ Related Video (Using VLOOKUP function in Excel): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGz6QuEaOo0 Click the link below to Subscribe to the Trump Excel Channel: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=trumpexcel Free Excel Course - https://trumpexcel.com/learn-excel/ Paid Online Training - https://trumpexcel.com/excel-training/ Best Excel Books: https://trumpexcel.com/best-excel-books/ ⚙️ Gear I Recommend: Camera - https://amzn.to/3bmHko7 Screen Recorder - techsmith.z6rjha.net/26D9Q USB Mic - https://amzn.to/2uzhVHd Wireless Mic: https://amzn.to/3blQ8uk Lighting - https://amzn.to/2uxOxRv Subscribe to get awesome Excel Tips every week: https://www.youtube.com/user/trumpexcel?sub_confirmation=1 Note: Some of these links here are affiliate links! #Excel #ExcelTips #ExcelTutorial trump excel, vlookup with multiple criteria, vlookup multiple criteria, #Excel #ExcelTips #ExcelTutorial	27	Education	PT8M12S	492	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1O8EcSYfgbQ/maxresdefault.jpg	1	295418	1939	78	0	136

Inserting an image in a cell in Excel is the easy part. You can easily use the option to insert Pictures in the Insert tab in the ribbon. But if you leave it at that, then that's not the right way to insert an image in a cell in Excel. When you resize the cell or move it or filter or hide it, the image will not follow along. The image will not stick to the cell but instead act as an object above the worksheet. In most cases, what you would want is the image to stick to the cell and get hidden or filtered or resized when you change the cell. To make sure this happens, you need to take some extra steps, which I show in this Excel tutorial video. In this video, I will show you how to insert an image into an Excel cell in a way that it sticks to that cell. So, in case you size or filter/hide the cell, the image will follow along Here are the steps to insert a picture/image into a cell in Excel: -- Go to the Insert tab. -- Click on the Pictures option (it’s in the illustrations group). -- In the ‘Insert Picture’ dialog box, locate the pictures that you want to insert into a cell in Excel. -- Click on the Insert button. -- Re-size the picture/image so that it can fit perfectly within the cell. -- Place the picture in the cell. A cool way to do this is to first press the ALT key and then move the picture with the mouse. It will snap and arrange itself with the border of the cell as soon as it comes close to it. If you have multiple images, you can select and insert all the images at once.

Here are the two ways you can access Spell Check in Excel: -- Go to Review Tab and Click on Spellings -- Press F7 Key from the keyboard There are many options available in the Spell Check Dialogue Box: -- IGNORE ONCE: If spell check encounters a word it identifies as an error, but you want to keep it that way, you can click on Ignore Once. This will ignore that error once. -- IGNORE ALL: If excel identifies a word as error, but you want to keep all instances of that word (as is), click on Ignore All. -- ADD TO DICTIONARY: If Excel flags a word as error but it is the correct word to be used (maybe it’s a name or abbreviation that you use in your company), then you can add it to the dictionary. When such a word is flagged as error and you click on Add to Dictionary, Excel will make that a part of acceptable words and won't flag it again. Note that this word is now part of Excel dictionary and would never be flagged in any of the workbooks. -- CHANGE: When Excel highlights an error, it also shows some suggestions (for example it suggests Good in place of Goood). There can be one or more that one suggestion. Select the suggestion that you want to use and click on Change to apply that. -- CHANGE ALL: If you click on this button, it will change all the occurrence of the misspelled word with the selected suggestion. AutoCorrect: This option will change the misspelled word with the selected suggestion, and also add it to the auto correct list. This means, that next time you type the same misspelled word, excel would automatically convert it into the suggestion that you selected. -- DICTIONARY LANGUAGE: You can change the dictionary language using this drop down.

This dashboard uses a simple dataset that is quickly summarized using drop-down lists, combo boxes, and Excel formulas. It also uses helper columns to make sure that as soon as someone selected an item from the drop-down list, the data filters to show only the records with that selected item. And the filter is additive, which means that now if you select another item from another combo box, it will further filter the data and give you the records which have both ṭhe selected items. Also, there are formulas that summarize the data to show you some useful values on the side. While this is a simple dashboard in Excel, it can be useful when you're getting into meetings or client calls. You can share this type of dashboard well ahead of the meeting/call and it's easy for you and your client/team to follow along. It also saves time and it allows you to instantly see the summary data right on the worksheet as soon as you use the combo box.

This dynamic Excel filter allows you to type the filter text in a text box and instantly extracts the records as you type in the search bar. While Excel already has a filter and advanced filter functionalities, these are not dynamic. Which means that you will have to specify the criteria and filter, and then change the criteria and filter again. This dynamic Excel filter, on the other hand, filters the data as soon as you change the text in the search box. This Dynamic Excel filter can be created in 3 steps: -- Getting a unique list of items (countries in this case). This would be used in creating the drop-down list. -- Creating the search box. Here I have used a Combo Box (ActiveX Control). -- Setting the Data. Here I would use three helper columns with formulas to extract the matching data. You can use this dynamic Excel filter when you have a huge dataset and you want to quickly filter it by entering the text. Since this is dynamic, you can remove the existing filter by simply deleting the text in the text box and type something else to filter based on it. While this advanced dynamic Excel filter works great with a small dataset, you may find that it tends to get a bit slow when you have large data sets. This is because it uses formulas and helper columns which can lead to slow processing time and data analysis.

You can use this technique to fetch all the file names from a folder and list that in Excel. This Excel trick uses an old Excel Function - FILES. FILES function can be used to get the list of all the file names (or specific file names) in a specific folder in Excel. It an old excel function that does not work in the worksheet, but still works in named ranges in Excel. All you need is this formula with the folder address. To get the folder address, save the excel file in the same folder and use this formula - =SUBSTITUTE(CELL("filename"),RIGHT(CELL("filename"),LEN(CELL("filename"))-FIND("@",SUBSTITUTE(CELL("filename"),"\","@",LEN(CELL("filename"))-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(CELL("filename"),"\",""))),1)),"*") One of the good things about this method is that it allows you to get specific files from the folder. For example, if you want to only get Excel files or only Word Files, or Only files with a specific extension, you can do that using this method.

While there are functions in Excel (such as VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH) to lookup and fetch a value from a list, to do a picture lookup in Excel, you need to use a little bit of workaround. This would involve the lookup formulas as well as named ranges. To do a Picture lookup in Excel, you need to have the images and use named ranges to fetch it. I take an example of the football clubs from the English Premier League to show you how the logo appears when you select the club's name from a drop-down. There are four parts to creating this picture lookup in Excel: 1) Getting the data set ready. 2) Creating a drop-down list to show item names (club names in this example). 3) Creating a Named Range 4) Creating a Linked Picture. Picture lookup (Image lookup) technique can be useful when you have a list of products with names (or list of companies with logos) and you want to quickly select one of the products and want the picture to update automatically. This can also be a really cool lookup technique when you're creating dashboards. You can make a selection change and as soon as you do it, the entire dashboard updates including the images/logos in it.

This technique shows you how to create a searchable drop down list in excel by using a mix of Excel Formulas and VBA. You will learn how to create dynamic search bar where it will show a list of all the matching records as you type. The idea here to have a searchable drop-down list where you type a few characters of a text string and it shows you all the matching values. This is inspired by the Google auto-suggest feature that shows relevant search results and also helps save time. As soon as you type a few characters in the search box (which is a combo box), the search box shows you all the matching results. You can then select any of the results and that will be populated in the search box. This technique uses a VBA code in the back-end, so you need to make sure your Excel file is saved as a macro-enabled file. Also, this is a way to create a searchable drop-down list in Excel, but it sometimes tends to act funny. Also, it's best to use it when you have less number of records only. With a high number of records, it can slow down, or even worse, hang.

For example, if you have a drop down list that shows products in the company, then selecting any one of the products would enable the dependent drop down to show the version of the selected product only. This means that when you select an item from a drop-down list, another list which is dependent on the first one automatically gets updated. Here is another simple example. You have two drop down lists with the first one showing countries and the second one showing states. You select the US, and all the states in the US appear in the adjacent drop down. And when you select India, all the states in India appear.

This Excel trick is extremely useful in situations where you have a huge dataset and you want to extract part of it by making a selection. For example, suppose you have the sales transaction records or various products. You can use this technique to select the product item from the excel drop down list and all the records for that item would get extracted and listed separately. Since this is dynamic, you can change the selection from the drop down, and the results would update instantly. There are three steps in extracting data based on a drop-down selection: 1. Create a Unique list of items. 2. Create a drop down to display these unique items. 3. Use helper columns to extract the records for the selected item. It also uses Excel formulas (INDEX, MATCH, ROWS, and SMALL functions) to extract the data based on the drop down selection. It can work for extracting the data on the same or different worksheet in Excel This is a great way to give the user the flexibility to quickly filter the data and get the records that they need. For example, you can create this to quickly extract the data based on the selection of country name from the drop down. As soon you the selection is made, this will filter all the records for that specific country. And you can select another country from the drop-down and it will instantly update and show you the results from the second country. You can also extend the concept shown in this video to create multiple filters. For example, you can select country and product name and it will extract the data of records that match both the criteria.

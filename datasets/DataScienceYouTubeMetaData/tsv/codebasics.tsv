Now just a disclaimer, in order to learn deep learning you don't need to have such an expensive setup. Whatever laptop or personal computer you have should still work ok. If you have a requirements for running heavy jobs, you can utilize cloud for that. For me, NVIDIA gave 2500$ Titan RTX GPU for free and than I spent close to 1000$ for other parts to build this PC. My plan is to run some heavy deep learning jobs on this computer and I will be making videos on that in future. Special thanks to my nephew (Harsh Patel) who helped me a lot during entire PC build process. Thanks Harsh! :) PC Parts ======== Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 3700 8-Core Motherboard: Asus ROG Strix B450-F Gaming Motherboard GPU: NVIDIA Titan RTX SSD: Sabrent Rocket Q 1TB SSD Power Supply: Thermaltake 650 W power supply 32 GB RAM Cooling Graphite Thermal Pad (To keep the CPU cool) BenQ 27 inch monitor Thermaltake V200 Tempered Glass Case (Cabin) Magnetic LED strip (for inside lighting) Wireless keyboard and mouse Website: http://codebasicshub.com/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/codebasicshub Twitter: https://twitter.com/codebasicshub Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/codebasics	27	Education	PT6M23S	383	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5QhqkZxf1js/maxresdefault.jpg	1	3171	207	1	0	34

Why is it that deep learning is taking off in recent years? The data growth due to IT adoption, IOT devices, social media is generating so much truth so that deep learning algorithms can really produce useful results. Neural network and deep learning shows its real power when training data size is huge. Due to advancements in hardwares such as GPU and TPUs one can run so many computations in parallel making it possible to run deep learning training in a reasonable amount of time. Python and opensource ecosystem on the other hand reduced the barries for people who don't know programming and they can try python with pytorch or tensorflow and write deep learning programs easily. One doesn't need to buy expensive hardware, they can rent a machine in a cloud and can still write machine learning programs. There is a prevalent AI boom in the businesses nowadays where all business executives want to benefit from artificial intelligence. This further accelerates the growth of deep learning.

Once sales directory of atliQ hardware has decided to invest in data analysis project he will do a meeting with IT director, data analytics team to come up with a plan. They will use AIMS grid to define purpose and success criteria of this project. AIMS grid simple explanation:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6118I9HViuQ Once AIMS grid is defined, next step is data discovery. In this step, data analyst team approaches IT team within an organization who owns software system that keep track of sales records. These records are stored in mysql database. Power BI can be plugged to this database to pull necessary information required for data analysis. I also discuss ETL, OLTP, OLAP and data warehouse concepts. Many times we need separate data warehouse or OLAP system to run our data analytics queries but in our project we will directly use mysql database.

There are certain tasks where human outperform computers such as image recognition, cognitive thinking, creativity, driving cars etc. Machine learning is a sub domain of artificial intelligence where set of statistical and neural network based algorithms are used for training a computer in doing a smart task. Deep learning is all about neural networks. Deep learning is considered to be a sub field of machine learning. Pytorch and Tensorflow are two popular frameworks that can be used in doing deep learning. Data science on the other hand a field where data is used to generate business insights. It can use machine learning techniques but data science can be done without using machine learning as well. One can use Microsoft excel to draw insights from data. Visualization and BI tools such as tableau and power BI can be used to plot powerful business reports that can give lots of insights about a business.

We will then use GridSearchCV and try different models with different hyper parameters to come up with a best model that can give us maximum accuracy. We will use sklearn classification_report to check the performance. Once we select best model based on GridSearchCV we can evaluate it on X_test and y_test to get a feel of how it is going to perform in production. Confusion matrix is used with seaborn visualization to get an understanding of classification errors for each of the classes. In the end we export the model to a file using joblib.

If companies are paying so high for data scientist jobs, it must be not very easy to become a data scientist. However many times people live in inferiority complex thinking that they are not good at math, statistics, or programming hence they can't become data scientist even though they have a passion in this field. My suggestion is to ask yourself "have you followed the right resources to learn data science skills?" For example, to learn math I always advise people to use these resources, Great resources to learn math: https://www.mathsisfun.com/ https://www.khanacademy.org/ 3b1b youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw Also for python programming, this tutorial playlist is something that even middle school student can follow along easily, Python tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3usILfyvQlvUBokXkHPSve6S Other than following the right resources one needs to ask if you are right-brained or left-brained person. Are you interested in data science and analytical job? Data scientist job is so much in demand and there is a lot of competition so certainly, while it is not easy to become a data scientist if you are committed and ready to do hard work with a lot of discipline it is certainly not very hard as well.

The formula for IQR is very simple. IQR = Q3-Q1. Where Q3 is 75th percentile and Q1 is 25th percentile. Once you have IQR you can find upper and lower limit by removing this formula, lower_limit = Q1-1.5*IQR upper_limit = Q3 +1.5*IQR Anything less than a lower limit or above the upper limit is considered outlier. We will use python pandas to remove outliers on a sample dataset and in the end, as usual, I have an interesting exercise for you to practice Code & Exercise: https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/ML/FeatureEngineering/3_outlier_IQR/3_outliers_iqr.ipynb Link for kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mustafaali96/weight-height Topics 00:00 What is percentile and IQR 04:15 Remove outliers using IQR 06:55 Exercise Website: http://codebasicshub.com/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/codebasicshub Twitter: https://twitter.com/codebasicshub Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/codebasics	27	Education	PT8M2S	482	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A3gClkblXK8/maxresdefault.jpg	1	3025	114	0	0	52

Many times these are legitimate values and it really depends on the situation if you want to remove them or not. But removing outliers can significantly increase the statistical power of machine learning model hence it is recommended that you treat outliers before building a model. Z score indicates how many standard deviation away a given sample is.

They are useful in implementing set/map class in different programming languages. They provide efficient way of search an element in log n complexity. There are various traversal schemes you can use such as breadth first search and depth first search. In depth first search you can use in order traversal, pre order traversal and post order traversal schemes that will benefit in different scenarious. For example in order traversal gives you a sorted list of elements in a tree. After going through theory we will implement binary tree, rather binary search tree in python.

Data structures are basic building blocks of any software program. One can not become a good programmer without a sound understanding of data structures. This is the reason, interviewers ask data structure questions in any programming interview. They store data in a specific memory layout and based on what type of problem you are solving it might become necessary to use one data structure versus the other. The few most common data structures are array, linked list, tree, stack, queue, etc. In this video, we will understand what data structures are and their implementations in different programming languages.

We can't measure this using absolute terms such as time in seconds because different computers have different hardware hence we need a mathematical way to measure time complexity of a program and Big O is that mathematical way. The basic idea is to come up with mathematical function for a running time and consider only fastest growing term and discard other terms as well as constants.

We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.

Data science is a process of getting insights from data. You don't have to be deep learning expert in order to do data science, you can do that in plain old microsoft excel also (if dataset is small enough). In recent years volume of data has grown too much so that data has become BIG DATA. Microsoft excel can't work with big data hence you need tools such as, #DataScience #WhatIsDataScience #DataScienceForBeginners #DataScientist #DataScienceTutorial #DataScienceWithPython #DataScienceCourse 1) Apache hadoop and apache spark: For database storage and distributed computing 2) Python and R: For data science programming 3) Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, MATLAB, Jupyter Notebook: For data visualization 4) Sklearn, Deep Learning, Tensorflow, PyTorch: For deep learning and machine learning Data scientist has become the most popular job in the market today and there is a huge career scope if you know how to do data science. Some of the use cases of data science in real life are, 1) Healthcare: Diagnostic prediction and accuracy 2) Finance: Fraud detection, predictive analysis on loans, stock market movement, company future 3) Shipping: Figure out best route for shipping 4) E-commerce: Product recommendation, inventory pricing Very Simple Explanation Of Neural Network: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER2It2mIagI Form to fill out your definition of data science (Fill free yo use innovative, poetic, funny language) https://forms.gle/ukkQKddkiwna1H1L7 Website: http://codebasicshub.com/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/codebasicshub Twitter: https://twitter.com/codebasicshub Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/codebasics	27	Education	PT6M47S	407	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JL_grPUnXzY/maxresdefault.jpg	1	48500	787	9	0	119

Then we will see how GridSearchCV helps run K Fold cross validation with its convenient api. GridSearchCV helps find best parameters that gives maximum performance. RandomizedSearchCV is another class in sklearn library that does same thing as GridSearchCV but without running exhaustive search, this helps with computation time and resources. We will also see how to find best model among all the classification algorithm using GridSearchCV.

But how do we handle text information in dataset? Simple approach is to use interger or label encoding but when categorical variables are nominal, using simple label encoding can be problematic. One hot encoding is the technique that can help in this situation. In this tutorial, we will use pandas get_dummies method to create dummy variables that allows us to perform one hot encoding on given dataset. Alternatively we can use sklearn.preprocessing OneHotEncoder as well to create dummy variables. #MachineLearning #PythonMachineLearning #MachineLearningTutorial #Python #PythonTutorial #PythonTraining #MachineLearningCource #OneHotEncoding Code in tutorial: https://github.com/codebasics/py/tree/master/ML/5_one_hot_encoding Exercise csv file: https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/ML/5_one_hot_encoding/Exercise/carprices.csv Exercise solution: https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/ML/5_one_hot_encoding/Exercise/exercise_one_hot_encoding.ipynb Topics that are covered in this Video: 0:47 How to handle text data in machine learning model? 1:38 Nominal vs Ordinal Variables 2:44 Theory (Explain one hot encoding using home prices in different townships) 3:39 Coding (Start) 3:51 Pandas get_dummies method 7:48 Create a model that uses dummy columns 12:45 Label Encoder 13:29 fit_transform() method 15:40 sklearn OneHotEncoder 19:59 Exercise (To predict prices of car based on car model, age, mileage) Next Video: Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 7: Training and Testing Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwY9Qv96DJY&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvCeTYTeyfe0-rN5r8zn9rw&index=7 Populor Playlist: Data Science Full Course: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3us_ELKYSj_Fth2tIEkdKXvV Data Science Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdfbcdP75KI&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu7clOTtwsp94PcHbzqpAdg Machine learning tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmvvaobm7eQ&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvCeTYTeyfe0-rN5r8zn9rw Pandas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmorAWRsCAw&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uuASpe-1LjfG5f14Bnozjwy matplotlib: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqwf4Vuj8oM&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu4Lr8_kro2AqaO6CFYgKOl Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eykoKxsYtow&list=PLeo1K3hjS3usILfyvQlvUBokXkHPSve6S Jupyter Notebook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_BzsPxwLOE&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uuZPwzACannnFSn9qHn8to8 To download csv and code for all tutorials: go to https://github.com/codebasics/py, click on a green button to clone or download the entire repository and then go to relevant folder to get access to that specific file.

In this case it makes sense to train a model and save it to a file so that later on while making predictions you can just load that model from a file and you don't need to train it every time. Pickle and sklearn joblib modules can be used for this purpose. Joblib seems to be more efficient with big numpy arrays hence it is preferred when you have many numpy objects involved in your training step. #MachineLearning #PythonMachineLearning #MachineLearningTutorial #Python #PythonTutorial #PythonTraining #MachineLearningCource #TrainingDataset Code: https://github.com/codebasics/py/tree/master/ML/4_save_model Topics that are covered in this Video: 0:01 - Saving trained model to the file 0:14 - How to solve a problem using machine learning? 1:33 - Coding 2:06 - Save model using pickle module 5:10 - Save model using joblib module 5:13 - Difference between pickle and joblib?

If you are a newbie just starting out with programming then python is probably the best place to start. Also for experienced programmers it makes sense to learn python because code development speed is very good and one can to fast prototyping. Python is used heavily in data science, machine learning, scientific computing due to its rich set of libraries (modules). So come and learn python with me :) Topics that are covered in this Video: 0:08 It is easy to learn and very intuitive programming language 1:02 You can develop code really fast in python whereas with other languages it takes relatively longer time. This is so because, * The code syntax is compact * There is no compilation. Python is interpreted language so you save time on compiling the code. * It has rich set of libraries so for pretty much anything you can just import a library, write couple of lines using that and you are done 2:45 Rich set of libraries or modules 3:24 Used heavily in the fields of data science, machine learning and scientific computing 3:52 Plenty of job opportunities Next Video: 1.

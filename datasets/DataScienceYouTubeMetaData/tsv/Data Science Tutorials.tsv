Pandas profiling is a new package which helps you automate the entire data exploration steps that you usually do when starting a data science or machine learning project. Data exploration is a key piece and usually a data scientist spends somewhere around 5 ot 10% of the entire data science project time on data exploration to create charts and metrics to better understand the data. This pandas profiling package helps you automate all these steps so that you can focus more on analysis and less on writing code to generate that analysis.

Data Science Process?	In this video I have talked about what is data science, data science history, people involved in making data science popular and data science process. Data science term started sometime around 2001 when William S. Cleveland written a paper about Data Science but this is not made it popular. It took almost around 8 to 10 years to really see the data science in action. Data science success is hugely depend on the advancement in big data storing and processing which enabled the programmers to apply the algorithms on that and make prediction. It is said that Mike Loukides Who in 2010 worked as the vice president of Content strategy for O’Reilly Media, helped bringing data science in mainstream. Also Thomas H. Davenport and DJ Patil article about Data Science : The Sexiest Job of 21st Century, really helped getting the attention of organizations and individuals. And today every organization whether public or private, adopting big data and data science as their most important process to predict the future and make better decision. Also in this video you’ll find the process of data science which at a high level, followed in every company and I also talked about the various data science teams job titles that are required to make a fully functional great data science teams. Here are the links to the articles William S. Cleveland who, in 2001, wrote "Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1403527?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Mike Loukides Vice President of Content Strategy for O'Reilly Media helped to bring Data Science into the mainstream in 2010 with his article "What is data science?" https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-data-science Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century - Thomas H.

Machine learning is a buzz word today where every company or every other person is talking about and want to go in this field. Whether a fresher or an experienced person or MBA etc. they all want to go in the field of machine learning because it is one of the highest paying job. But before going in the machine learning, you need to understand what is machine learning, how it has gain the popularity in last couple of years and companies that have contributed in the success of machine learning. So machine learning is a set of programs / algorithms that basically takes a huge data to understand the patterns, behavior and trend from this data and then make a prediction. In the traditional systems or machines we used to provide only data and set of rules to process the data but in machine learning we provide not only the data but also the answers that we expect machine learn and then tell us whenever the same situation is arising in future. This helps to reduce the burden on mind to remember each and every transaction and analyze them and learn what each and then group of transactions are saying. And we are then talking the help of machines to basically learn all of this knowledge from data and help us making the better and informed decision on a day to day basis. Machine learning algorithms like neural networks, logistics etc. where developed in 19th century but because there was not much processing power was available; they could not really use the algorithm at its full potential. With the advancement in the storing and processing the big data, company started using the machine learning because now have they all the power to story and analyze the millions and billions of rows in couple of seconds and then apply the machine learning algorithm on it to understand what each row is saying. With this advancement now almost every other company is adopting the big data and machine learning to process and analyze the huge datasets that they have and take the knowledge out for better future prediction. What is machine learning, how machine learning is different from other programming languages, machine learning 2019, history of machine learning, history of big data, google big data, yahoo big data Hadoop, machine learning application, machine learning explanation, machine learning definition, machine learn use cases, learn machine learning, machine learning,	27	Education	PT23M4S	1384	2d	hd	false		1	96	2	1	0	0

It’s easy to create heatmaps in Tableau. Simply change the mark type to density and off you go. You also have a number of configuration options for working with heatmaps in Tableau. Change the density around a mark by adjusting the Size slider to modify the area where marks have influence, apply a weight to the density by dropping a measure on Color, or show more or fewer hot spots in the data by adjusting the intensity slider. We also created new color palettes designed for light or dark backgrounds to align with visual best practices. And existing capabilities like filters, pages, and small multiples all work intuitively. First Map is created using one measure. Second Map is created using two measures , one having only positive Value, Other having both positive and negative values.

Cross val score helps identifying whether the model accuracy is increasing significantly or not by adding a new variable. If it is not, then you can drop that variable otherwise add it. Selecting the best model in scikit-learn using cross-validation In this video, we'll learn about K-fold cross-validation and how it can be used for selecting optimal tuning parameters, choosing between models, and selecting features. We'll compare cross-validation with the train/test split procedure, and we'll also discuss some variations of cross-validation that can result in more accurate estimates of model performance.	27	Education	PT7M49S	469	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3Hnjo5wBRjc/maxresdefault.jpg	1	1482	19	0	0	2

In this python machine learning video I have talked about how you can achieve the ordinary least square linear regression using python statmodels package. We review what the main goals of regression models are, see how the linear regression models tie to the concept of linear equations, and learn to interpret the coefficients of a simple linear regression model with an example. This is the first video in what will be, or is (depending on when you are watching this) a multipart video series about Simple Linear Regression. In the next few minutes we will cover the basics of Simple Linear Regression starting at square one. And for the record, from now on if I say "regression" I am referring to simple linear regression as opposed to multiple regression or models that are not linear. Regression allows us to model, mathematically, the relationship between two or more variables. For now, we will be working with just two variables; an independent variable and a dependent variable. The truth is, when we talk about how "good" a regression model is we are actually comparing it to another specific model. Oftentimes, students do not realize this. So in this video, we are going to talk about that idea. I will also begin introducing basic terminology and concepts that will carry you through your work using regression. There are no formulas or calculations in this video. We are just introducing the underlying meaning behind "good" regression models. So if you are new to Regression or are still trying to figure out exactly what it even IS...this video is for you.	27	Education	PT4M37S	277	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L_h7XFUGWAk/maxresdefault.jpg	1	10626	47	17	0	3

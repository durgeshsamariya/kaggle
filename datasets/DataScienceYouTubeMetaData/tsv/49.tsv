I always said, "Don't worry - they can't kill it until there is a viable replacement with a macro recorder." Today, in Public Preview, Office Scripts offer a macro recorder that records TypeScript. This will be the product that eventually kills Excel VBA. Listen as deal with the stages of grief as I try to figure out if I can figure out typescript. This is a first look at the Macro Recorder and trying to understand TypeScript.

First: make sure you have a function called UNIQUE. You don't need UNIQUE in this method, but if you don't have UNIQUE, then you don't have spillable arrays and you need to watch this instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbaXnT5CX18 Included in this video: 1. Creating a frequency distribution from random data using a bins array and the FREQUENCY spilling function. 2. An odd bug with the Histogram chart. Why you could choose Pareto first and then switch back to Histogram to avoid the bug. 3. Using NORM.INV instead of RANDARRAY or RANDBETWEEN to generate data that has a standard normal distribution.	26	Howto & Style	PT4M32S	272	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WF008wBi5P8/maxresdefault.jpg	1	1856	98	4	0	18

This feature has been introduced in 2017 and is available to anyone using Office 365, Excel online, or Excel on the iPad. In order to co-author, the workbook has to be stored on the OneDrive or SharePoint. For regular features, like entering data and formulas, the co-authoring experience should be great. A colored box shows which cells are being updated. These boxes update quickly. Changes to other endpoints are shown in a few seconds. There are ways to break it - using Pens on the Draw tab of the Ribbon is one way. Excel might ask you to refresh the workbook on each endpoint if you hit one of these errors. The message telling you that the workbook could not be uploaded and offering Save a Copy is useless - you would be creating a forked version of the workbook.	26	Howto & Style	PT12M35S	755	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lx9XF1EtL-g/maxresdefault.jpg	1	68715	304	37	0	40

But 99.9999999% of the time, we have to deal with AutoSave, which is horrible. You have to change your workflow. Don't count on Save As after you make changes.

If you ever use RANK or Sort, you could be impacted. Fundamental belief: Excel stores 15 digits of precision. How RANK returns duplicates How RANK+COUNTIF eliminates duplicates Mystery where RANK+COUNTIF still returns a duplicate Four cells contain 1.15 =A2=A3 shows the cells are equal Ctrl+` shows the cells are equal But the four cells do not sort correctly. Something is different. Change the XLSX to a Zip file Open the XML inside the Zip File What? Excel is storing 17 digits!?! So - is that a good thing? More accurate, right? Maybe 16-digit credit card numbers stored as numbers, right? Hooray? But... while some functions only use 15 digits (COUNTIF and equality tests) others use 17 digits (RANK and sorting). One formula that uses a mix of RANK+COUNTIF will potentially return the wrong answer. What happened to "Recalc or Die"? One workaround, wrap your values to be ranked in =ROUND(A2,14).	26	Howto & Style	PT8M26S	506	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WZfjmbEDbfI/maxresdefault.jpg	1	1414	52	0	0	17

Apparently... Yes. But it requires some workarounds. Custom Lists can be 254 items but the total length of the items (including a theoretical column between each item) is 2000 characters. Don wants to sort by a custom list that is numeric! Will this work? It seems to work! But you can not import numeric cells to the custom list dialog box. So, try to type numbers into the Custom List dialog box…. You are struck with a foolish 255 character limit when typing. WTH is the limit? 254 items? Aha - 254 items, but less than 2000 characters when you add the invisible comma between each item Did some text math with =SUM(LEN()) +CtrlShift+Enter and LEN(TEXTJOIN(",",True,Range)) Workaround with ABS for sorting in this particular case for Don.

My one rant about a merged cell is that the selected range gets larger when you touch a merged cell I was always frustrated because I couldn't make the selection narrower again. Steve from Huntsville: keep holding down shift key, click in the cell just below the merged cell. Or - keep holding down the shift key and press Down, Left, Left This assumes that the merged cell is at the top, not in the middle of your range. If the merged cell is in the middle, you can not narrow the selection - use Center Across Selection instead.

Bill's first method using Text to Columns (found on the Data tab). In step 1, choose delimited. In step 2, choose a space. Skip step 3 by clicking finish.  The text will split at each space, so anything with three words will end up in 3 cells. Put those back together with =TEXTJOIN(" ",True,B2:E2) or with =B2&" "&C2&" "&D2 Mike's first method uses Power Query. Power Query is Get & Transform in 2016 or a free download for 2010 or 2013. First, convert your data to a table using Ctrl+T. Then, in Power Query, from Table. Split Column, by Delimiter. Select Space and then at the left-most delimiter. You can re-name a column by double-clicking! Close & Load To… and choose a new spot on the worksheet. Bill's second method is to use Flash Fill. Type new headings in A, B & C. Flash Fill will not work if you don't have headings! Type a pattern for the first two rows. Go to the first blank cell in B and press Ctrl+e. Repeat for column C. Mike's second method is to use these formulas: For the first part, use =LEFT(A2,SEARCH(" ",A2)-1) For the second part, use =SUBSTITUTE(A2,B2&" ","")	26	Howto & Style	PT9M45S	585	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wFxXBn8Wbi0/maxresdefault.jpg	1	2397	75	0	0	11

The date always includes a month name, but might be in different formats. Mike and Bill offer alternate strategies. Bill's super wide approach: Put all 12 months in separate columns Use the FIND function to see if this month is in the original text To find the minimum starting position, use =AGGREGATE(5,6,… A few extra formulas to look for a number 2 or 3 positions before the month Mike's approach: Use SEARCH instead of FIND. Find is case-sensitive, Search is not. Create an function argument array operation by specifying B13:B24 as Find_Text. The formula returns #VALUE! Error, but if you press F2, F9, you will see that it is returning an array. The first 13 functions in AGGREGATE can not handle an array, but functions 14-19 can handle an array. 5=MIN and 15=SMALL(,1) are similar, but SMALL(,1) will work with an array. LOOKUP, SUMPRODUCT, CHISQ.TEST, INDEX, and AGGREGATE can handle function array arguments without Ctrl+Shift+Enter Mike was smarter by looking to see if 2 characters before the Start is a number, and then grabbing 3 characters before.

Traditional sentiment analysis is not flexible - you will rebuild the dictionary for each industry. Excel uses MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon (read about that at http://bit. ly/1SRNevt) This generic dictionary includes 5,097 negative and 2,533 positive words Each word is assigned a strong or weak polarity This works great for short sentences, such as Tweets or Facebook posts It can get fooled by double-negatives To install, go to Insert, Excel Store, search for Azure Machine Learning Specify an input range and two blank columns for the output range.

For example: use decrease decimals to show a rounded version of the number. Excel still stores all of the decimals, but simplifies the display. There are 11 number formats in the drop-down on the home tab. Click the dialog launcher to get to Format Cells dialog. Today, we are talking about the formatting codes in the Custom group. I don't have all the knowledge here today, so if you have better tips, put them in the YouTube comments. A zero in the format code says Excel must display the digit. A # sign says they may display the digit if there is enough precision, but they don't have to when there is not. A ? will leave space for the digit to keep the decimal place lined up. There can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 formats, separated by a semi-colon. When there are 2 formats, the first is for zero and up. The second is for negative. When there are 3 formats, the third if for zero. 4th format is for text. Using the number format to display text with number or to display text instead of number. Specifying a color for a zone. To change [Color 5] visit Excel options. *x to repeat x up to the numbers , at end to divide by 1000 ,, divides by millions Using conditions in the zone _x will leave space the size of "x" m mm mmm mmmm mmmmm d dd ddd dddd [h]:mm	26	Howto & Style	PT18M38S	1118	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZCai3ZWMmPI/maxresdefault.jpg	1	1546	61	0	0	5

One common solution is to add a row of helper cells with the column number. Another less-efficient solution is to use COLUMN(B2) inside the VLOOKUP formula. But, doing 12 VLOOKUP for each row is very inefficient Instead, add a helper column with a heading of WHERE and do a single Match. The MATCH takes as long as the VLOOKUP for January. You can then use 12 INDEX functions. These are incredibly fast compared to VLOOKUP. The INDEX will point to a single column of answers with $ before the rows.

An array formula can do thousands of intermediate calculations. They often require you to press Ctrl+Shift+Enter, but not always. The best book on array formulas is Mike Girvin's Ctrl+Shift+Enter. INDIRECT lets you use concatenation to build something that looks like a cell reference. Dates are nicely formatted but are stored as a number of days since January 1 1900. Concatenating two dates will point to a range of rows in Excel. Asking for the ROW(INDIRECT(Date1:Date2)) will "pop out" an array of many consecutive numbers Using the WEEKDAY function to figure out if a date is Friday. How many Fridays occur in this July? To watch a formula calculate in slow motion, use the Evaluate Formula tool How many 13ths occur this year? How many Friday the 13ths happened between two dates?

The better question would be how it returns the right answer at all when you break the rules. Today, I explain the gory details behind the Binary Search used by the VLOOKUP(,,,True) and show how manipulating key values at the quartiles of the lookup table can send the VLOOKUP into the wrong quadrant of the table. Bottom line: Don't use the VLOOKUP(,,,True) with an unsorted table.

But Rekha needs current month from last year, current month from this year, variance, then YTD through current month from last year, YTD this year, variance. Urgently. In Excel 2010. While this would be a perfect report for Power Pivot, Rekha hasn't come up the Power Pivot learning curve yet. And we need the report urgently. I am calling this an impossible pivot table because once you group daily dates to months and years, you are not allowed to add a calculated item inside the pivot table to show a variance. Many ideas flashed through my mind: Run the data through PowerPivot and used Named Sets. Make two pivot tables side by side, one showing monthly and one showing YTD. Abandon pivot tables and use SUMIFS instead. I ended up using the GetPivotData technique, although there are probably dozens of ways to approach this impossible problem.	26	Howto & Style	PT6M39S	399	2d	sd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T48wri-Pzz4/maxresdefault.jpg	1	9271	69	1	0	10

However - the formula will change depending on if you want to mark both halves of the duplicate or just the 2nd occurrence of the duplicate.	26	Howto & Style	PT6M31S	391	2d	sd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kqDici4SEUY/maxresdefault.jpg	1	748	10	0	0	2

The co-worker sends you the linking workbook but not the linked workbook. Perhaps there is some confidential information in columns B through R of that workbook.

Enter age, gender, lab result and then lookup the rating in a table to indicate if someone's risk is low, moderate, high, or very high. Tom wants to return the result as a color (green, blue, yellow, red) via conditional formatting to the lab result cell. Today's podcast has a little of everything: rearranging the table, exact match, Less than Match, subtracting the number 1, OFFSET, assigning a formula to a defined name, then even a linked picture (aka Camera Tool) lookup for good measure. Bill always says that 99% of his VLOOKUPs end in False. For today's solution, that statistic drops to 25%.	26	Howto & Style	PT8M56S	536	2d	sd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yk62Ng9CVk4/maxresdefault.jpg	1	2031	21	1	0	4

You want to keep one of those constant, but change the other 5 references to point to a new range. Today's episode shows two methods - one involves dragging a range five times, the other is even more convoluted.

Jim is a fan of an iPad game called Dots. You have a 6x6 grid of dots that appear in four colors. You are trying to find the longest connection of dots of the same color. Jim wondered if Excel could generate a random 6x6 grid of four colors of dots to look for patterns. In today's episode, see how to use RANDBETWEEN, conditional formatting and a custom number format to generate the grid of dots. But finding patterns is going to be tougher. While the human brain can detect the patterns, a formula in Excel to find the longest connection would be tougher. The video ends with some conditional formatting to highlight the possible connecting cells but no method for finding the longest connection.	26	Howto & Style	PT4M52S	292	2d	sd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cxe7dybcB9g/maxresdefault.jpg	1	3450	34	1	0	5

Sheet1 contains customer, item, and quantity sold. Sheet2 is a price list with unique prices per customer name. I could have solved this with PowerPivot or with a two-way lookup. As I started to do the lookup, though, I discovered that the sales database include a lot of items that are not in the pricing table. Some are simple misspellings, but others are simply missing.

In Episode #1719, Bill shows us how to Select Precedents with the Keyboard *or* the Mouse; how to go back to the Original Cell with the Keyboard, and a One-line Macro to go back to the Original Cell using the 'Cringe-Worthy' SendKeys method in VBA. Use Excel® 2013 VBA and Macros to automate virtually any routine task, and save yourself hours, days, maybe even weeks. Then, learn how to make Excel do things you thought were simply impossible! You'll discover macro techniques you won't find anywhere else and learn how to create automated reports that are amazingly powerful and useful. http://www.mrexcel.com/store/index.php?l=product_detail&p=257 For more information on Excel 2010 VBA and Macros, check out...

Mansoor asked an interesting question for today's New Widescreen Podcast. Can you assign a Color to each Unique Value in a Column, and then automatically re-use that Color when the same Value is entered. Bill understands that in order to perform the required spec, this operation will require a VBA Event Handler Macro to analyze each entry. However, the logic is similar to what you would use in Excel: use =MATCH() to figure out if the Value appears above. If the Value is found, then re-use the Color from the matching Cell. Otherwise, create a random Color using three =RANDBETWEEN() Functions. Follow Bill in Episode #1718 to see how the result is achieved and the Color Values are applied.

I spent a week in Lucerne Switzerland at the 8th annual Trainer Days. This is a team of Microsoft Office Trainers who began getting together once a year to teach each other new tricks in Office. Today, they allow others to attend. I was their guest speaker for Trainertage 2013. Now, the obvious problem: I don't speak German. But they were patient. I spoke slowly, and everyone got along well. My friend Tony Dejonker helped with translation during my first session, but it was decided that my "Slow English" was good enough for the remaining three sessions. First observation: doing training for other trainers is tougher than my normal sessions. I always learn a new trick or two from the audience in a normal session; usually someone in row 2 shows me up. I expect it, and have a prize for it. At Trainertage, it was less than 1 minute and 30 seconds into my presentation when the first trick came from row 2, and more flooded in from row 2 all night. Some even from row 1 and row 3! Second observation: When I would watch another trainer's session in Deutsch, I would learn new stuff. I couldn't understand the language, but I would pick up things that I had not seen in the U.S. These new friends of mine all learned from books in German and attended their own sessions and had learned a whole new set of tricks. I joked that I was going to steal these for the podcast, and they were all cool with that. "It is not stealing, it is sharing". They learned from me, and I learned from them. In my first episode of Things That I Learned at Trainertage, I lead off with a trick from the mother of Trainertage; Tanja Kuhn. Yes, you might be smart enough to build a dynamic range using OFFSET and COUNTA, but you won't have to anymore with this clever twist on using Ctrl+T. Today, in Episode #1632, Bill shows us a new dimension in Dynamic Ranges. ...This blog is the video podcast companion to the book, Learn Excel 2007 through Excel 2010 from MrExcel.

Regular pivot tables can't do that. Starting in Excel 2010, OLAP pivot tables can do that. But, that doesn't help you if you have regular old Excel data instead of OLAP cubes. However...take your regular Excel data through PowerPivot and it turns into an OLAP Cube! Thus, Named Sets become an option. Chapter 12 makes me want to run every single data set through pivot table. I need to turn back to Chapter 3 to remind myself of why not to do that...	28	Science & Technology	PT4M6S	246	2d	sd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AvSKQ9yI9iw/maxresdefault.jpg	1	40159	82	1	0	6

Episode 836 will show you how to successfully get the coin as the background of the pie chart. This blog is the video podcast companion to the book, Learn Excel 97-2007 from MrExcel.

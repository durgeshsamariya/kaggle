Modelling day to day problems in Excel	We had to switch power providers soon, so I started reviewing the options. There are heaps of providers in New Zealand and each offer a ton of different plans. Some offer welcome bonus or credit worth up to $ 200. Other offer straight forward rates. Some others offer discount if you sign up for both electricity and gas with them. So how do you decide which one is better for you? Using Excel of course. The result is awesome. I ended up saving more than $1000 with a simple model. Puzzled? Curious?
